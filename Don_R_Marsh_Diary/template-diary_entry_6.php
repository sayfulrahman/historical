                1944, a Task Force consisting of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion, 66<sup>th</sup>
                Armored Regiment, 14<sup>th</sup> Armored Field Artillery Battalion, 1 Platoon
                of Company “A” 17<sup>th</sup> Armored Engineer Battalion, 2<sup>nd</sup>

                Armored Medical Battalion, attacked the town of Gathemo and east along a ridge
                line on the flank of the German counterattack towards Avranches. Very heavy
                resistance was encountered and the enemy massed heavy artillery and heavy
                weapons fire from anti-tank guns in a desperate effort to stop the attack of the
                Command. After heavy fighting, the balance of CC“A” joined the task Force on
                13 August, took Ger and seized Hill 329 the next day.<span

        <font face="Arial"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal">On 20 August 1944, CC“A” began
                an attack North and Northeast towards Elbeuf. We had taken Breteuil-Newburg and
                were approaching St. Andre in a nighttime march. We were enroute to a crossing
                at the Seine River at Mantes-Gassicourt in a double column that stretched for
                endless miles behind us. It was 23 August, near 2100 hours and pitch dark as we
                were trying to follow the vehicle in front, maintaining vehicle intervals
                without tailgating. It takes all of your concentration to focus on the two small
                taillights. &nbsp;<o:p>

    <p class="MsoSubtitle" align="left" style="text-align:left">
        <font face="Arial"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal">Without warning, suddenly we heard
                an aircraft, a German JU88, circle over the top of us. He then climbed off in
                the distance. After circling, he dropped a magnesium flare. We knew at once that
                it was a Kraut plane and not one of ours. When I saw the flare drifting, with
                its brilliant light, I thought, “Somebody is going to catch hell now.”
                Little did I realize it would be us.&nbsp;<o:p>

    <p class="MsoSubtitle" align="left" style="text-align:left">
        <font face="Arial"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal">As the flare drifted closer
                illuminating our miles of stalled columns, the plane passed overhead strafing us
                with guns blazing, but not before dropping his bomb. It landed directly in front
                of us about three vehicles forward almost on the road right next to the
                Executive Officer’s Command half-track. After the terrific explosion, 27 year
                old Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Mart Bailey, Jr., West Point “M” Company
                Class of 1939, was mortally wounded and died within moments after calling out,
                “Help me. Somebody help me.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Other
                members of the half-track crew were also severely wounded by the bomb blast and
                fragments. A Master Sergeant lost his arm; I assumed that he died from trauma
                and loss of blood. Others nearby were hit by bomb fragments and also suffered
                concussion. We bailed out of our vehicles and ran into the nearby fields. Some
                stayed on their .50 caliber ring mounted machines guns to fire at the plane,
                when he made another and final strafing run at the road lined with vehicles
                bumper to bumper. We had been sitting ducks. We recovered and the advance
                continued throughout the night. General Collier replaced Colonel Bailey with Lt.
                Colonel Wilson M. Hawkins from the 66<sup>th</sup> Armored Regiment as his
                Executive Officer.&nbsp;<o:p>

                Elbeuf, France was seized despite heavy resistance. During this action, The
                Command advanced so rapidly that it ran off its maps and made the final assault
                without them. The resistance was so aggressive that one column attacking from
                the Southeast, consisting of primarily of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion, 66<sup>th</sup>
                AR, was cut off for two days and nights. After the city fell, Elbeuf was turned
                over to the Canadian troops in return for a “receipt for the city” requested
                by Colonel John H. “Peewee” Collier, Commanding officer of CC“A.” We
                then moved to a new assembly area near Mantes-Gassicourt, crossing the Seine
                River on 28-29 August 1944 and continued attacking northeast. The advance of the
                division was so rapid that it moved with six columns abreast. What slowed us
                down the most were the huge throngs of the local populations that turned out
                enmasse to greet their liberators in every village and city. We witnessed young
                women from many of the villages being rounded up in the town square to have
                their heads shaved – payback time for having “associated” with the
                despised German soldiers during their occupation.&nbsp;<o:p>

                the Somme River near Arras and Cambrai. XIX Corps issued orders on the night of
                31 August 1944, to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division to capture the city of
                Ghent (Tournai) within forty-eight hours. Earlier the XIX Corps had been
                relegated to lesser role in Belgium, the honors being reserved for the British
                under General Montgomery. The Corps directive to take the town by midnight was
                met by CCA with two hours to spare. BG Collier radioed his command had arrived
                at 2200 hours and was requesting new orders. &nbsp;<o:p>

                ARRAS-CAMBRAI road in the late afternoon of 1 September, the Combat Command
                coiled and outposted both columns for the night; prepared to proceed in the same
                direction the following day. During this drive, enemy units attempting to escape
                tried to break through from the west, while the CCA columns were heading for the
                Belgium border. These units, which included 2 Mark V tanks, 9 towed AT guns and
                approximately 170 vehicles were engaged by our tanks and artillery and
                destroyed. 450 prisoners were taken during this engagement.&nbsp;<o:p>

                “Peewee” Collier arrived with the full CC“A” command representing the
                largest force to enter at that hour. Major General Edward Brooks followed right
                behind the 82<sup>nd</sup> Recon Battalion. When Brooks came upon Lt. Col.
                Wheeler Merriam, 82<sup>nd</sup> Recon CO, stopped with his A and B Companies to
                refuel, he asked Merriam why he had stopped short with his advance, only to be

                Hickey, one of his Combat Commanders, to be the first of that unit to cross the
                border; mistakenly under the impression that they were the first to cross the
                border. When the Belgium government recognized the 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored
                Division as the first to enter and liberate their country, they erected a
                monument on the spot and they awarded the full division the Belgian Fourragere

                but that wasn’t in the cards – far from it. We remained in this area for two
                days because we had run out of fuel. Refueled and rested, we moved to a bivouac
                area between Diest and Hasselt, Belgium on 8 September 1944. Hasselt later
                became the Division Rest Center. 12 September 1944 General Brooks turns over

                    in the woods he escaped and on Sunday, September 17<sup>th</sup> met with other
                    stragglers who were then collected in the village of Moorveld for transfer to
                    defend Geilenkirchen. Two months later he was captured in the Hurtgen Forest and
                    became a Prisoner of War. He wrote that he was thankful the tankers from the 66<sup>th</sup>
                    Regiment didn’t kill him, as his friend Werner died in that action. Hubert
                    Gees and I continue to exchange season greetings and correspondence – former

                the Command crossed the border into Germany at Wehr and Hillensberg near
                Geilenkirchen. Until 30 September, CC“A” remained in a defensive position
                southwest of Geilenkirchen defeating, with heavy casualties, German
                counterattacks with armor and infantry. Total prisoners taken 67, killed 220, 22
                vehicles destroyed and 12 assault guns. At that time the Command assembled in
                the rear of the front line to prepare for the breakthrough of the Siegfried
                Line. We were relieved by the 115<sup>th</sup> Infantry Regiment. The 2<sup>nd</sup>

                life, you get a decent break. Our break was being assigned to the Dutch village
                of Brunsuum, Holland. If there ever was a “soldier’s dream spot” – this
                was it. The population could not have been more hospitable and openly friendly
                to their liberators, in every way. They showered us with food and beverages.
                Most spoke English as a second language. We were welcomed into their homes and
                made friendships that lasted for decades long after the war. Many of our troops
                returned to marry their Dutch girlfriends. One comes to mind, Charlie Boss and
                his Wilhelmina, who found true love.&nbsp;<o:p>

                crew had lost two members, Fred Newland and here Joe Elfer. Elfer being the
                driver of the ton &amp; – wire truck, we requested a replacement from the
                Signal Company, but were told none was available. So Lt. Moll asked for and
                received a driver (TDY) from the Division Services Company – one Private
                Charles Boss. He was short in stature, about 5 foot 2inches and wiry, but
                boisterous and out-going. Charlie fit in immediately. His “I don’t give a
                damn” attitude was a great example of GIs who had reached the point after two
                years service where rank – their own (or lack thereof) or others – no longer
                made a difference. Charlie could be borderline insolent in dealing with officers
                as he came close to the line, but always spoke to them with a disarming smile on
                his face. He flourished in our circle as a hot dog, but never showed any fear as
                a driver.<span style="mso-spacerun:

                between the medieval legions of the Duke of Julich (Germany) and the Duke of
