    <p><b>DIARY ENTRY #15</b></p>
    <h1 class="center">BERLIN HONOR GUARDS</h1>
    <p class="center"><i><b>By Don R. Marsh</b></i></p>
    <p>
        22 April 1945. The city of Wolfenbuttel, Germany had not
        been noticeably damaged and most if not all of the city housing remained
        untouched. Even the municipality services were operating. When ordered to find
        suitable quarters, we located a small cottage about two blocks away from
        CC&quot;A&quot; Headquarters. I said let's check it out and walked in without
        knocking at the door. An elderly German lady dressed in the customary black
        clothing of a widow met us as we entered. Standing at her side were her three
        daughters. All four showed fear in their faces when as the spokesman I told them
        simply, &quot;Five minutes, raust!&quot; The widow, I learned her name later,
        Frau Decker, began clasping her hands and begging in German not to be thrown out
        of her home, to no avail. To the victors belong the spoils. No amount of
        pleading and begging served to change our minds and they then began gathering
        what they could of any personal possessions and left weeping. Nearby neighbors
        seeing their plight took them in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Frau Decker would come by daily and ask permission to
        clean her home. She would attempt to persuade us to leave, but that fell on deaf
        ears. The three daughters - the oldest in her early twenties was named Waltraut,
        the next about 20 was named Ilsa and the younger daughter about 15 named Hilda.
        The latter was fluent in English, but we never learned that until much later.
        Once we assured Frau Decker that her daughters were in no danger of being
        molested, she permitted them to accompany her to clean the house daily. After
        the tension had broken, Frau Decker explained that her only son had been taken
        prisoner in North Africa where he had been serving with Rommel's Panzers and
        captured. His whereabouts were unknown at this time. Presumably he was in the
        USA with the others captured in North Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
        May 7th arrived and there were not any celebrations for
        V-E Day as there were back in the States. The day the Army pulled us off the
        line - 20 April 1945 -- and said the war is over for our division was our day -
        even then there were no celebrations. With the peace came new orders -
        absolutely no fraternizing with the German civilians (meaning women); that also
        fell on deaf ears, if you were discreet. Women everywhere were willing to wash
        our clothes and some willing to provide other &quot;services&quot; - for a
        single package of American cigarettes. Hunger was also a problem for the
        civilians and soon a black market spread all over Germany in order for the
        people to survive. Money was of no value in a barter market. Amazing what people
        will do to survive and feed themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
        While we were forbidden to speak to the Germans in public
        that didn't stop the small kids from coming up smiling and asking, &quot;Soldat,
        haben sie chocolat?&quot; We gave them candy from our rations and they soon
        began asking for chewing gum. Their older sisters asked for cigarettes as soon
        as the sun went down. Our officers turned a blind eye as long as you didn't
        flaunt it in public. Our Headquarters CO, Captain Louis Bifano, would warn us at
        the Company Roll Call formation that if caught, you were liable to a
        court-martial and punishment in the form of a fine. That also fell on deaf ears.
    </p>
    <p>
        Things then happened fast. First we were issued the new
        style OD uniforms with the &quot;Ike&quot; jacket, and then issued shoe polish!
        The three of us Privates First Class in the wire team all were promoted to T/5
        (Technician Fifth Grade), while Veno remained a buck Sergeant. We took note of
        the fact that only three of us - Veno, Hull and I who left England to make the
        Invasion were still here. Of course Donahue who joined us early in France was
        also on board, but all the others were now gone.
    </p>
    <p>
        On May 24th the Belgian government bestowed on the whole
        2nd Armored Division the Belgian Fourragere for two noteworthy causes; being the
        first Allied Division to enter and liberate their country on September 2, 1944
        officially at 0930 hours and for our participation in the Battle of the Bulge in
        stopping the deepest penetration made by the German forces at Celles. We proudly
        wore their honored &quot;red cord of war&quot; on our right shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Army announced a point system under which men with the
        most points earned would be the first to return to the States, which seemed like
        a fair system - we received five points for each for the five campaign stars
        earned in the war. Five per each personal medal awarded. We received one point
        for each month served in the USA prior to shipping overseas and two points per
        month for each month served overseas - fair enough, so far. But then men with
        dependent children were given 12 points for each child, which we thought totally
        unfair. I got five points for each battle and somebody with a kid got 12 points?
        Two points more for a kid than any two of the bloody campaigns we endured? The
        cut-off established was 85 points. I had 81 points. The Army was very generous
        in granting anyone recommended for the Bronze Star for Meritorious Service - we
        called it the &quot;Atta-boy&quot; medal. If only Lt. Moll had made the
        recommendation for all four of us, who survived that eleven months of war under
        his direct command, as many other Division Signal Wire Officers had done, that
        would have given me the magic number -- but for whatever reason he failed to do
        so. C'est la vie.
    </p>
    <p>
        S/Sgt Charlie Tichacek was a hustler first class, he told
        me to get the wire jeep and we took off for Braunschweig (Brunswick). Through
        the grape vine Charlie learned of a German brewery where we could trade gasoline
        for a pony barrel of beer with the tap included. We couldn't scrounge any ice,
        but we brought the keg back to Decker's house and even shared it with some of
        Decker's elderly neighbors. When that keg was drained we went back and got
        another.
    </p>
    <p>
        But now the old-timers were starting to leave for home as
        we said goodbye to both Charlie and Bill Veno. The Decker family had mellowed
        out and no longer saw us a permanent &quot;guests&quot; as May came to a close.
        Shortly after we packed up to move. Our next stop was to a former gasthaus along
        the route the Military Government had commandeered for the Berlin bound road
        march. Just the three of us, Hull, Donahue and myself were all that remained on
        the wire team as the Division assembled in the Bernburg area on June 19th.
        Within a few days the Company sent us two new replacements to join the team.
        Other changes were happening rapidly. General White left for the States and BG
        Collier became the Division CO. We were now reassigned from the Ninth Army to
        the Army of Occupation Seventh Army.
    </p>
    <p>
        On July 3rd a light rain began falling as the lead
        elements moved out and crossed the river at Torgau. We were entering the Russian
        Zone. At a Russian road block checkpoint the front of the column was stopped and
        refused permission to pass by the sentinel on duty. When General Collier back in
        the column inquired why the delay, he was told of the Russian refusal to let the
        column pass. With that he called for one of our new Pershing tanks to get up to
        the head of the column and run over anybody in their way. So much for Soviet
        diplomacy. We moved on without further hindrance.
    </p>
    <p>
        CC&quot;A&quot; entered the outer ring of Berlin near dusk
        on July 4th, led by our guides. We learned that both the 82nd Airborne and 101st
        Airborne Divisions had sought to be the first American division to be chosen as
        honor guards for the Berlin Potsdam Conference and meeting of the Big Three
        occupational powers. However, General Eisenhower made the decision to go with an
        armored division as a show of force. The 2nd Armored Division had undeniably
        earned this honor. As our endless column of tanks and armored vehicles entered
        the city proper, the main streets were lined with solemn looking elderly men and
        women who stared at us in silence. Apparently, their Teutonic mentality told
        them that we were the lesser of the two evils they had to contend with in the
        years to come. They had already felt the Russian fist in the early months of
        brutal occupation and wanton abuse by the rampaging Russian Army.
    </p>
    <p>
        While mile after mile of Berlin was decimated with an
        estimated ten square miles of buildings demolished, the section of Berlin
        assigned to us was in far better condition in contrast to the bulk of the city
        we traveled through to reach our assigned housing area. We were quartered in
        what once had been very expensive homes owned by the elite bankers and
        professionals on a tree-lined street. Remarkably, not so much as a windowpane of
        glass was broken in any of these homes we occupied. Miraculously they had
        escaped the years of bombing by the Allied Forces.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Army had trucked in folding canvas cots for our
        sleeping arrangement in the huge homes. I selected the oak paneled library for
        Hull and I. Donahue having been assigned to head up the CC&quot;B&quot; wire
        team. Lt. Col. James Power became the new Executive Officer at CC&quot;A&quot;
        and briefed us on his policy. The Officer of the Day would make a bed check
        every night and any man found absent would be court-martialed. However,
        realizing how ineffectual the non-fraternizing regulations were being enforced,
        being the gentleman that he was, he advised us if we intended to spend the night
        &quot;elsewhere visiting friends,&quot; to fold our cots and put them out of
        sight. No empty bed no one missing. Any wonder that Colonel Power as well liked
        by the men!
    </p>
    <p>
        Our residential neighborhood was too quiet so Hull and I
        got the jeep and headed for all the &quot;action&quot; in the Russian Zone.
        Crossing Check Point Charlie on the Unter den Linden was no problem as we looked
        for Friederich Strasse, in the Russian Zone of the city, on the east side of the
        Brandenburg Gate. The cafes had live music and dancing with plenty of German
        women - plus Russian female soldiers in uniform. The liquor they were selling
        represented as vodka tasted liked it had been cut with gasoline! A few drinks of
        that and we were afraid to light up cigarettes! Getting acquainted with the
        German frauleins was easy as they all wanted to meet the Americans - by mutual
        arrangement. Lake Wansee was a great spot for &quot;German-American&quot;
        friendships.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to meeting the ladies of Berlin, sightseeing
        was on everyone's mind. Hull and I had full use of our wire jeep and spent every
        day checking out the different sections of the city. We found the Tiergarten by
        chance and learned it was Germany's biggest outdoor black-market center. While
        walking through the park, who called out my name but none other than Sergeant
        Herman Moeller, my old nemesis from the 143rd Signal. Moeller was now a Tech
        Sergeant assigned to the Military Affairs Section and proudly wearing a Purple
        Heart ribbon. We exchanged handshakes and greetings and I noted he had the
        Purple Heart ribbon so I gave him the needle by saying, &quot;I see they nearly
        got you, Moeller. Too bad he wasn't a better shot.&quot; He laughed and said
        that he noticed that I hadn't lost my rare sense of humor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything imaginable was on sale! A pack of American
        cigarettes, any brand, went for $10 -- $100 a carton. The MPs were out in force
        so you had to use caution. We would use condoms to blouse our pants legs on our
        combat boots then put ten packs in each pants leg. When you made the sale you
        accepted the currency and then dumped the smokes as you opened the condom for
        the goods to drop to the ground. The embryonic ATM machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        Speaking of currency, all military services were paid in
        German Occupation marks. Each of the three powers printed an identical
        universal-type script using twelve digits. The only difference in the printed
        occupational money was the first numerical digit. The numeral &quot;1&quot;
        being American, the British a &quot;2&quot; while the Russians used the hyphen
        instead of the first numerical digit. The problem was then transferring the
        money sent home in American dollars. The GI Company mail clerks who controlled
        the purchase of US Postal Money Orders, sold in one hundred dollar
        denominations, became wealthy - they charged us $150 for every $100 dollar Money
        Order bought. Pocketing the other $50 bucks. There was no other way out except
        to pay the price.
    </p>
    <p>
        Watches were the top item every Russian soldier wanted to
        buy with the paper money they could not take back to Russia nor send it home as
        we did. The typical Russian soldier had not been paid since the war began and
        they all carried a purse slung over their shoulder loaded with the &quot;funny
        money&quot; when shopping at the Tiergarten. They were sought any watch with a
        round face dial - plus a bonus paid for one with a sweep second hand. Our HQS
        CC&quot;A&quot; received two Swiss Omega wristwatches in PX supplies. While the
        enlisted men drew a lottery ticket to decide the single winner, the officers
        took the other watch. Sgt. Johnson from Tennessee won the watch. He sold it to
        me for $100. The next day at the Tiergarten a Russian paid me $1,200 for it!
        When the word got out that I had made a bundle, our CO, Captain Louis Bifano
        approached me and asked if I would sell his watch for him (meaning I had to take
        the risk being caught by the MPs). I offered him $250 for it and he turned me
        down. I passed on the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
        It wasn't all business for us in our spare time as we took
        time to check out the Reichchancellery building where Hitler supposedly killed
        himself in his bunker. The Main Attraction going on was the Potsdam Conference.
        It was a galaxy of stars - the combined Chiefs of Staff and every big shot
        general and admiral of note was there to share the limelight as they rode in our
        half-tracks on parade to review our tanks arranged in parade formation. Generals
        Eisenhower, George C. Marshall, Hap Arnold, George Patton, Field Marshall
        Montgomery, Prime Minister Churchill, President Harry Truman, Secretary of War
        Stimson and a host of other dignitaries including the Russian generals were
        present. Our 2nd Armored Division CG, BG John H. Collier was all smiles with
        pride riding in that select group. Along with the others, I could now say,
        &quot;Ich bin eine Berliner!&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        Like thousands of other GI's with human instincts and
        emotions, I spent some time in &quot;Cherchez la Femme.&quot; However, I met my
        special fraulein quite by accident and maybe fate meant it to be that way. I was
        over in the Tiergarten area near the Unter den Linden trying to sell an Omega
        wristwatch to some Russian Ivans, when two young attractive gals caught my eye.
        They were trying to trade pieces of gold jewelry for American cigarettes, for
        which they would then barter with the German underground blackmarketeers in
        return for food. They were not having much luck when I approached them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The brunette fraulein took one look at me, put her hand to
        her mouth and gasped an exclamation that caused her girl friend to sharply turn
        to look at me. After they exchanged whispered bits of conversation between
        themselves, none of which I could understand. I then tried my best Milwaukee
        Deutsch sales pitch on them by saying, &quot;Guten tag, Frauleins, wie gehts es
        Ihen?&quot; Thus began our conversation. Due to my limited German vocabulary,
        they switched to their high school English and saved the day for me. And so
        began our &quot;meaningful relationship.&quot; The brunette, named Augie, and I
        hit it off at once.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometime later, when I mentioned our initial meeting and
        asked her why she had appeared uneasy when I first approached her, she shocked
        me with her frank answer. She came right to the point and told me that the
        resemblance between me and her dead husband was uncanny. He had been an
        Unterofficer on a German submarine that never returned from a mission in the
        North Atlantic early on in the war and was presumed dead. Without a further
        word, she then produced a couple photos from her purse of the young man in
        uniform. I had to agree that we could have passed for twins. Was it any wonder
        that the expression on her face registered with me on the day when we first made
        eye contact. I realized that it must have been quite a shock to her under the
        circumstances. For looks, figure and personal grooming, this was not your
        typical heavy-set German female, but rather an intelligent, shapely, city bred,
        well educated person trying to survive in the hostile divided city of Berlin. No
        easy task under the conditions prevailing at that time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The warm days and nights of July and August were more than
        welcome. Outside of roll calls and nuisance formations, there weren't too many
        restrictions or obligations placed on us, so we had plenty of off-duty time.
    </p>
    <p>
        But all too soon our summer was drawing to a fast close.
        Our division was alerted that we were being relieved by the famed 82nd Airborne
        Division. On August 9th the 82nd Air Borne Division received orders to relieve
        our division of Berlin occupational duty. We began the westward road march on
        August 17th on the Autobahn headed for Kassel. Thus, on the final morning of our
        mass departure, our mile-long convoys wound their way on to the Autobahn to head
        west towards the City of Kassel. We were now enroute to the division's final
        destination at Bad Orb. After we had cleared the city, the MPs halted the
        columns at key check points and began a vehicle search for unauthorized
        occupants. I was amazed at the number of German women dressed in GI uniforms
        that they extracted from our vehicles. Driving a jeep, I was in no position to
        hide any passengers, so the thought never entered my mind
    </p>
    <p>
        Long before our President John F. Kennedy would say to a
        Berlin audience, &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner,&quot; I, too, was able to echo the
        very same expression fifteen years earlier. Apparently, I was deep in thought as
        we crossed the final Russian checkpoint and my mind was neither on the route nor
        the trip that was ahead of me, so I do not have any particular recollection of
        that journey
    </p>
    <p>
        We reached the city of Bad Orb, located just west of
        Frankfurt. Hull and I were relieved from TDY assignment to Combat Command
        &quot;A&quot; and rejoined the 142nd Armored Signal Company. By this time, Doug
        Donahue had returned from duty with CC&quot;B&quot; and rejoined Hull and I. As
        we looked around the Company area, we recognized but very few faces. The
        majority were new replacements, all the old-timers having left for the states in
        June and July. Shortly after being at Bad Orb it was only a matter of days when
        I was told that I had enough points to return to the US via the pipeline, as I
        was in the next group to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
        September 4th arrived and I celebrated my 23rd birthday
        quietly waiting for my orders to start my journey home. Didn't have long to wait
        for on September 10th I said goodbye to Hull and Donahue, they were all that
        remained from our team that landed in France back in June of 1944. My number and
        name was called and I climbed aboard a truck headed for the port at Marseilles,
        France. Adios, amigos. It was time to call it a day and another experience of
        life had come to a close.
