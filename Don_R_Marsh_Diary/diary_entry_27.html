<h2 align="center"><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&quot;Der Teufel Los&quot;</font></h2>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 30 March 1945 the 507th Heavy Tank Breitkeil (wide
front) Konigtiger Panzer Battalion, was attached to the SS--Regiment Holzer
defending Hamborn and Paderborn with 15 of the King Tiger tanks of the 3rd
Kompanie setting road blocks on both sides of the road in the west near
Kuhlenberg. The Kompanie Kommander, Hauptman Wolfgang Koltermann, with five
tanks of the 3rd Zug (platoon) was hidden in the woods in the high ground on the
north side of the road defending the route to Kirchborchen and Hamborn Schloss.
The 1st and 2nd Zugs with five tanks each were well hidden on the south side of
the road blocking off the approach to Borchen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 507th Headquarters Kompanie tank commanded by
Wolf-Dietrich &quot;Dieter&quot; Jaehn was blocking the east end of the road to
Dorenhagen and Eggeringhausen. The 2nd Kompanie, commanded by Hauptman
Maximillian Wirsching was east at Busch and also hidden in the woods. It was
comprised of nine King Tigers and 3 Feuerschutz Jagdpanthers (Tank Destroyers)
blocking the road to Eggeringhausen. These three Kompanies set the ambush that
totally destroyed the ill-fated assault on Hamborn by the US 3rd Armored
Division's Task Force Welborn; which also resulted in the death of its Division
Commander Major General Maurice Rose. See footnote #1</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tiger 88 main gun was deadly at 1,000 meters. The
American column with &quot;Big Six&quot; (General Rose's code name) were less
than 700-800 meters away and blindly approaching without sending out any
reconnaissance patrols. They had no knowledge of their pending disaster about to
occur. Koltermann could hardly believe his good fortune.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following German veterans were assigned to the 507th
Battalion on 23 September 1943 and were sent to the Russian front in March of
1944. After being credited with over 600 Russian tank &quot;kills,&quot; they
were returned to Sennelager on 6 February 1945 to be refitted with Tiger IIs.
Note those with the Ritterkreuz (Knight's Cross) decoration.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After ambushing Task Force Welborn, with disastrous
results for the 3rd Armored Division, the 507th Battalion CO, Major Fritz Shoeck,
gave orders to withdraw to the area near Dorenhagen. It is believed that it was
Koltermann's 3rd Zug (Platoon) 3rd Kompanie with orders to deploy and withdraw
to Dorenhagen who confronted General Rose on the road. Attempting to escape
eminent capture, Rose's jeep had passed two Tiger tanks going in the opposite
direction in the dark on a narrow road when the third tank blocked his jeep.
General Rose dismounted, surrendered and became a POW.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tank commander, of the third tank in road march
formation who remains unidentified among the names listed above, had blocked
Rose's jeep and was standing in his turret. After shouting unclear commands in
German to General Rose, he aimed his M38 Schmeisser machine pistol, set on
Dauerfeurer (full automatic) with the 32 round magazine, and without
justification, fired repeatedly at General Rose, who had his hands raised in
surrender; striking him fourteen (14) times, resulting in his instantaneous
death.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the record, neither the 507th Headquarters Kompanie
nor the 2nd Kompanie tanks were any where near the road location where Rose was
machine gunned.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After experiencing severe platoon leader prior losses on
the Russian front due to having taken the lead tank position, a change of
tactics was made to maintain platoon control; the Zug commander would now take
the third position in an attack, following his two lead tanks, called the &quot;Keil&quot;
formation. In a road march, the platoon leader would take a position in the
middle (third) in the straight line formation called &quot;Reihe.&quot; As the
Kompanie CO and tank commander, Koltermann, in Tank #301, after decimating
Welborn's column from the high ground and giving the orders to redeploy on his
radio with the third platoon, as CO he would have been in the third tank in the
road march deployment formation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, in spite of repeated requests, the 507th
survivors have refused to identify the specific 3rd Kompanie platoon leaders;
although the name and tank number of every tank commander in each of the 507th
Kompanies were recorded during this encounter on 30 March 1945 defending
Paderborn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four decades had passed and almost to the day when the
Sennelager-Paderborn Battle Field Walk Through was conducted by Major Philip
Halford Mac-Leod of the British Army in the British Zone of Occupation of
Germany on March 28, 1985; six veterans from the 507th participated. Present
were Koltermann, Jaehn, Jahn, Eychmuller, Reinhard and Stadler; with Helmet
Schneider as the recorder. This small group verbally recreated the Chronik
(History) 507th from memory, without notes or journals; later it was published
(edited) by Helmut Schneider.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at this meeting in late March, 1985, on the
fortieth anniversary of Passover/Good Friday of 1945 that this small group of
507th survivors met at Dieter Jaehn's home in Goettingen as his house guests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this meeting when the details leading to Rose's
indefensible death were being discussed when Koltermann made the following
startling explanation, &quot;Der Teufel los!&quot; (The Devil was loose!). Was
this a repeat of Macbeth's Banquo's ghost who disrupts a banquet? Was this
exclamation a mea culpa with these chilling words or an epiphany that caused
Koltermann to recall this night of terror and General Rose's killing without
justification or cause? Was he seeking absolution in an act of contrition -- or
disavowing any personal involvement and complicity? One can only speculate.
Koltermann was an old man also facing the specter of death in the few years he
had remaining. He died not long after, still denying knowing the name of Rose's
killer or giving the name of third tank commander's name. Koltermann knew the
name of each of his fifteen tank commanders in his 1st, 2nd and 3rd platoons;
and moreover, after the road mop up, by radio check he knew where each tank was
located when he gave the redeployment order of &quot;Tigers march!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had several letters of correspondence with Dieter
Jaehn, who is fluent in English. In being cooperative, he telephoned me on 22
August 1999 from his summer home in Nova Scotia, Canada to respond to my
interview and answer my many questions. In addition, at my request, he obtained
the photo of Wolf Koltermann from Widow Frau Koltermann and received her
permission to use her husband's photo in our biography of General Maurice Rose.
Frau Koltermann moved from Augsburg to Nurenberg after the death of her husband.
Jaehn also sent me photographs standing next to his Tiger Tank with two fellow
crew members.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sebastian Hupfl, a Bessarabien-German from Romania, known
as Wastl to friends, served in the 507th Tiger Panzer Battalion in the 2nd
Kompanie, in Tiger Tank # (203), 1st Zug (Platoon) under the command of Zug
(Platoon) Ladeschtz (Leader) Lt. Pfeuffer. Hupfl was the tank Richtschuetze
(main gunner targeting the 88 mm) with Fahrer (driver) Walter Ertl, Funker
(radio) Werner Schurig. The tank #202 commander was Stabsfeldwebel (Sergeant)
Voss. Tank #203 was commanded by Feldwebel Fritz Ebner. Tank number #204 was
commanded by Feldwebel Willi Wolf with Richtschtze (gunner) Jodl, Faher (driver)
Helmet Gunther, and Funker (radio) Hans Prager. In action the next day, 31 March
1945, near Altenbeken, 3 of the 507th Tiger tanks were knocked out in an ambush;
Ebner, Ertl and Schurig were killed; Voss was injured and hospitalized; Hupfl
was wounded and sent to hospital at Bad Driburg and was captured there. See
footnote #2</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While a Prisoner of War in November 1945, Hupfl requested
and was granted permission from the British Army POW Camp Commander to walk 20
kilometers to bury his dead comrades whose remains were still in the destroyed
hulls of their tanks. After burying their remains at Boedekkeen with the
assistance of a priest from Kirchborchen and marking their grave sites, he
returned to the POW Camp as promised. He escaped in the spring of 1946 -
stopping to visit the widow of Ertl, only to learn that she had left town with
an American soldier. He then returned to Freiburg where he made his home.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sebastian Hupfl sent me a copy of the Chronik 507
(History) along with his personal comments and notations in the margins; plus
extensive file copies including maps from the German Army Freiburg archives on
the history of the 507th from conception to the end of April 1945 when it ceased
functioning as a tactical unit due to its loss of tanks and men.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Footnote #1. The Germans (unsubstantiated) claim is that
100 young Waffen--SS prisoners were shot and killed by the US 3rd Armored
Division the next day in retaliation for General Rose's death. Quoted from
&quot;Das Kriegsende 1945 im ehemaligen Hochstift Paderborn&quot; Page 19 by
Waldemar Becker.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Footnote #2. See Chronik (History) 507 pages 237-255 -
especially page 250 for KIA. Page 250 Hupfl buries Ebner, Ertl and Schurig.</font></p>
