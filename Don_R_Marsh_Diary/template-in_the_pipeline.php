        <h1 class="center"><b>IN THE PIPELINE</b></h1>
        <p class="center"><b><i>By Don R. Marsh</i></b></p>
        <p>Within hours after docking at
            Glasgow, Scotland, on 17 November 1943, our contingent of 88 replacements
            arriving on the Liberty ship the George Sharswood, was herded on to the
            British Railways System funny looking rail cars headed for the infamous 10<sup>th</sup>
            Replacement Depot, Litchfield, England, APO #7245, NY, NY …. just more
            numbers passing through the army’s replacement system. We were met at the
            Birmingham rail yards by US Army trucks and loaded on” by the numbers” –
            an all too frequent expression of direction. As we passed through the decades
            old main gate of the former British peace time garrison, Norm Steele remarked
            that the 15 foot red brick walls looked like we were entering a prison. Little
            did we know his wisecrack was closer to the truth than we would imagine. It
            was run like a prison by a martinet Colonel we soon came to disdain. Colonel
            Francis Killian was courts-martialed shortly after the end of the war for
            condoning extreme measures and punishment on his post and in his Post
            Stockade.</p>
        <p>We unloaded from the trucks
            in front of one of several multi-storied old red brick buildings that formed a
            quadrangle around the hard top enormous parade grounds. We were assigned to
            Company C, 438<sup>th</sup> Battalion. Told to “fall in” and were marched
            off to our assigned barracks, led by a little Corporal. The cold heatless open
            type bays contained the typical double-deck bunk beds with the <i>thin</i>
            GI mattresses. Our section held 48 men. We
            drew bedding and quickly made the GI beds. Ordered to fall out and fall in, we
            were marched to the mess hall, <i>by the
                numbers,</i> by garrison cadre NCOs for breakfast. The mess hall was a huge
            battalion type building capable of feeding hundreds of men at the same time,
            unlike anything I had seen before. The remainder of the morning we were
            confined to the barracks awaiting orders.</p>
        <p>
            <o:p>
                &nbsp;</o:p>
        </p>
        <p>After lunch we were once
            again marched off to the post personnel building to recheck the records, once
            again, prior to selection by MOS to a permanent unit of assignment in need of
            our military specialty codes with open slots to fill. Long before computers it
            was now up to the (human) system relied upon to put the square peg in the
            square hole. Fate would play its hand for us all. In this crucial crap shoot,
            there are winners and there are losers at this point. After the shot records
            and rifle qualification records were verified, we were again marched off to
            the barracks and told to stand by.</p>
        <p>
            <o:p>
                &nbsp;</o:p>
        </p>
        <p>Late in the day, just prior
            to the Retreat Formation, a cadre NCO entered our barracks and told us to
            dress in Class “A” uniform and prepare to fall outside in formation. At a
            signal, the order was given. Men poured from every building in the quadrangle
            on the double and lined up in sections of three ranks. I estimated at least a
            minimum one thousand men participated in the evening parade. Standing in the
            center of the parade ground stood a small group of people. We formed in a
            single file, company by company, to march past the reviewing group. As we came
            closer to the group, I noticed one person was a young civilian girl
            accompanied by two men in civilian clothing, in addition to four American
            officers of various rank, including one full colonel.</p>
        <p>I was ten paces from the
            group when I noticed the girl who had been intently staring at us nudge the
            civilian with her elbow; he in turn said something to an officer, who in turn
            looked at me and said, “Step out of line soldier.” I knew then I had been
            chosen for something special but had no idea of the honor. A Captain stepped
            up to me and said, “Follow me soldier.” I was then ordered to stand next
            to a group of four other Army Privates, behind them stood a half dozen MPs at
            Parade Rest. I turned to ask the Captain, “What’s going on, sir?” when
            he snapped at me, “Shut up and stand at attention, you are under arrest!”
            I thought, “Holy shit! Now what did I get into?” Moments later all five of
            us “selectees” were marched off under MP guard to the Post Headquarters
            building and into the Post Commander’s Office for questioning -- one at a
            time.</p>
        <p>I was the fifth and last
            person to be questioned. It was then that I was told the reason I was being
            detained as a suspect. The crime … apparently the young lady in the parade
            grounds review group had been robbed and raped the night before in town in the
            pitch darkness by an American soldier, whose facial features she was unable to
            identify. The five of us, all Caucasian GIs were all about the same height and
            build fitting the general description. Now it was a simple matter of checking
            all of our whereabouts the previous night. The four other soldiers who were
            interviewed before me were questioned, found innocent and released. All had
            substantiated alibis that they were not in town the previous night, as having
            been on duty in various post duty capacities. I was ordered into the
            Colonel’s office and stood at attention as I saluted and said, “Private
            Marsh reporting as ordered, sir.” He never bothered to return my salute as
            all eyes in the room focused on me as he stared at me through his steel rimmed
            GI glasses and asked, “Well, where were you last night, soldier?”</p>
        <p>I quickly replied, “Scotland, sir.” His head jerked back and those cold blue eyes squinted as he
            didn’t get the answer he was expecting and demanded, “What the hell were
            you doing in Scotland?” I answered, “Sir, our ship just arrived at the dock from the States.”
            With that he ordered his Provost Marshall, who stood behind his desk, to check
            my reply with personnel as I was marched out into the corridor to remain
            standing at attention, with an MP on each side. I may have appeared calm, but
            inside was turmoil. In less than an hour the same MP Captain who had placed me
            under arrest, appeared and said, “You’re free to return to your company,
            soldier. You’re not being held. Your whereabouts last night have been
            verified. Welcome to England. Keep your nose clean. You may leave.”</p>
        <p>As I walked back to the
            barracks, I realized how close I had come to being charged with something I
            had not done and it gave me the shakes when the full realization hit home … God damn Army! A twenty-four
            difference and I would have had a real serious
            problem. As I got back to the barracks, among the guys asking what the hell
            had happened were: Harry Tuttle, Norm Steele, Jim Matthews, Ken Speers, Larry
            Hull, Bob Rosenberg, Lowell Dillard, Frank Ruffalo, Leo Walls, John Rossi, and
            others. After the war, Jim Matthews wrote about this command parade formation
            occurrence without mentioning my name in his memoirs. The barracks jokesters
            were saying the Royal Princess was inviting a Yank for a slumber party and I
            was the chosen stud. While they laughed I shrugged it off knowing that I had
            dodged the bullet that time.</p>
        <p>The Fickle Finger of Fate had
            almost nailed me! Instead, Destiny had more dangerous events planned for my
            future, none of which I might have chosen had I any choice in the matter. But,
            the Army not being a democratic organization, I had no say where I would be
            assigned. The luck of the draw and my name was among the 20 or more men with a
            wireman’s MOS on orders for the 143<sup>rd</sup> Armored Signal Company, 3<sup>rd</sup>
            Armored Division. Many of the others in our replacement package were sent to
            the 101<sup>st</sup> Airborne Division.</p>
        <p>The grim reaper was
            sharpening his scythe marking time. Goodbyes were made with those remaining
            behind or being sent elsewhere. Time to board another 6 x 6 GI truck and move
            on to the next stop along this transient line… going places and meeting new
            friends, as the recruiting poster promised. Their reception turned out to be
            anything but friendly … we were “<i>the
                new men!”</i></p>
        <p>The 3<sup>rd</sup> Armored
            Division was spread across the countryside of the western part of England
                mainly in the Warminster, Somerset County. We found the Signal Company quartered on a small farm near
                Cucklington that
                had previously commercially grew mushrooms prior to the war. Its dark
                windowless sheds that once housed the mushroom plants were the enlisted
                men’s barracks. Primitive would be an apt description of the interiors;
                consisting of rough concrete floors, rough planks on the dividing walls of the
                spread-out structure connecting the rows of buildings. A ledge of rough wood
                ran the full length of each shed. The mushroom tray ledge was designated the
                bed and frame for sleeping purposes. No inner spring mattress on this baby!
                Supply issued us each a British body bag with which we filled with straw
                obtained from a covered pile inconveniently placed on the outer fringe of the
                farm. We were issued two Army blankets and that completed the overseas home
                away from home Spartan accommodations. Our assigned barracks NCO was a <i>new
                    man</i> – Staff Sergeant Russell Kane. Others sharing the “barn” were
                Harry Tuttle, Ken Speers, Ed Robitaille, Norman Steele, Larry Hull, Paul Hake,
                Bill Emerson, Gerald Morey, John Kelly, Dick Prescott, George Rowe and Leo
                Kitts, among others -- all wiremen. A buck Sergeant from New York City, Murdo
                McCleod, joined us for a brief period, but was then reassigned to SHAEF
                Headquarters on a classified status.</p>
        <p>Arriving in mid-winter, we
            soon learned that the barracks did not contain any heat except that from two
            dim light bulbs at each end of the long shed. Few dared to undress for bed
            under those chilly circumstances and many nights we went to sleep in “boots
            &amp; saddles.” The coal stove shower room water heater was a joke with
            water that never quite reached the definitive stage of warm. The latrine was
            an even bigger joke. Strategically but inconveniently placed at the far end of
            the farm, down near the motor pool. The long walk in the black of night to
            relieve one’s bladder became a nuisance and many of us found a short cut. We
            would urinate against the side of the former tool sheds, then housing the
            privileged first three graders (NCOs), much to their disgust and complaints of
            repugnant odors. Threats did not deter the practice. Retribution was also a
            personal satisfying factor. The location of the latrine was mandated by other
            factors. The stench and odors from the open latrine with twenty “honey buckets” to collect the human daily
            waste
            deposits filled to near
            overflowing from over 300 men, plus an open 12 foot pissiore created an
            unpleasant odor that we hoped would waft over to the single farm house; which
            was the quarters for the company officers, including the Company Commander,
            Captain John L. Wilson, Jr., for whom no love was lost.</p>
        <p>The mess hall was built to
            accommodate perhaps 100 men at a sitting/meal; the 143<sup>rd</sup> Signal
            Company had over 300 men on its roster so that “dining” was a matter of
            timing. The firstest got the mostest for seating room. And the rest waited in
            the rain. That is the SOP for military life. Becoming adjusted to this “old boy” company never did quite
            reach
            that level for me – the coolness was
            evident daily from the top down. We -<i>the
                new men, </i>stayed on our side of the fence and only crossed over when “invited” – which was seldom.
        </p>
        <p>In
            time the First Sergeant reviewed our personnel 201 files and discovered that I
            had not received the customary 7 day furlough home prior to shipping overseas.
            He sent for me and said I was entitled to a seven day furlough to London, if I wanted it! On 7 February
            1944, I signed out of the Orderly Room and
            took off immediately by train. I checked in at the Red Cross Club in the West
            End District near Marble Arch. The days were spent on the city historic tours,
            the nights were another matter. The whores walked the streets soon after dark
            and the bars were full of GIs on the prowl. Instead I went dancing at the
            Covent Gardens Ballroom because I was informed that is where you could meet
            the British gals wanting to meet the Yanks. It all balanced out. It was on the
            first night there, when I noticed a very pretty petite girl who was dancing
            with a young Lieutenant serving with the Free French Army.</p>
        <p>The British, being civil, no
            one objected to a person cutting in on the dance floor, so I made my move. The
            Lieutenant graciously gave up his dance partner and I “turned on the Marsh charm” - only at first she wasn’t
            buying into another Yank with a
            bullshit yarn about her looking “exactly like the girl back home.” Truthfully, she actually closely
            resembled my
            former high school Italian
            sweetheart, Phyllis. Before the night had ended I had convinced her that she
            did. They honestly could have passed for sisters. I believed she was also
            Italian, but learned differently later. As the night of dancing and
            conversation continued, I became captivated by her smile, laughter and English
            accent. When she asked if her “image” back home (Phyllis) was pretty, I
            assured her that she was very pretty and that opened the door to more
            questions about her (the other woman-curiosity). Then she next asked if we
            were engaged I had to tell her that sadly Phyllis had dumped me in 1940 and
            moved away - leaving me broken hearted and unable to love again. This
            intriguing “confession” resonated with her as only a sympathetic female
            can relate. I immediately made a new friend.</p>
        <p>When
            the dance ended I asked if I could escort her home, to which she agreed. We
            rode the subway to the last stop of the line and then walked for numerous
            blocks beyond that. In the pitch darkness and typical London fog, I didn’t have the slightest idea where in
            the hell I was. As it turned
            out, where I thought she was Italian, I learned she was Jewish, which made no
            difference with me. I spent the remainder of my leave with her -- enjoying London and each other’s company.
            All too soon this brief fling of war time love and
            civilian freedom came to an abrupt end. Once more I had to return to the
            English farm at Cucklington becoming an American GI “mushroom.” Like
            the old proverbial tale, “They kept me in the dark and fed me bullshit.”
            But I didn’t buy it.</p>
        <p>The daily mundane repetitive
            drills and training sessions wore on us as the months turned from winter, to
            spring with summer was fast approaching. Also drawing closer day by day was
            the Invasion of Normandy - the sole purpose of our presence. The month of
            May and the training became intense in all fazes. Drills of climbing down the
            cargo nets representing the side of ships brought home the danger we would
            soon face in the next month of June. The passes to town were discontinued as
            we neared the lock-down and all mail was even more closely censored, yet it
            was no secret that in June the weather and tides would determine the date for
            the attack on the French coast. The count down at SHAEF Headquarters had
            begun.</p>
        <p>The third week into May the
            Orderly Room posted a surprise roster on the Company Bulletin Board listing
            the names of men being immediately transferred to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored
            Division. My name was among those listed. My previous verbal orders given by
            Captain Wilson of my being sent to TDY (Temporary Duty) with the 36<sup>th</sup>
            Armored Infantry Regiment were canceled and I packed my bags for the next move
            <b><i>in
                    the pipe line.</i></b> Once more it was time to say “adios” to old friends
            and the inevitable meeting of new friends at the next stop. Pipe line time was
            running out. A foot soldier’s Weltanschauung was soon to confront us all.
            Hell On Wheels … here I come.
