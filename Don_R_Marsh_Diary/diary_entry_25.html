<h1 align="center"><font face="Arial">VOICES FROM THE GARDEN OF STONE&nbsp;</font></h1>
<p align="center"><b><i><font face="Arial">By Don R. Marsh&nbsp;</font></i></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Arlington National Cemetery after midnight is as quiet
as any other graveyard …except when the silent soldiers entombed there meet
late at night to voice their concerns. You should go to Arlington on any quiet
night when the soft breezes are blowing among the shadows of the white marble
markers and you will hear the voices of the Stones, talking in whispers of
remorse and regret of their shattered dreams of these once young men.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If only those across town in government could hear what
they discuss night after night here among the white marble tablets bearing their
names, as well as the names of others who have fallen in battle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those sentinels on duty tonight are among the lost
generation from World War Two and Korea. Had they lived, today they might have
been grandfathers, old men of seventy plus and most in their eighties. But
destiny stepped in and decided that was not meant to be for them, they were to
become The Forgotten Ones. These silent sentries from the past are the symbols
of what might have been. They speak to each other, in soft voices, but no one
else hears their message.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the stillness of the night, one voice speaks with a
tinge of bitterness, &quot;I thought they (the politicians) would have learned
from the price we had to pay. When I died in the surf on June 6, 1944, on
Normandy's Omaha Red Beach, I wasn't even old enough to vote for those in charge
and here I am, stuck in this place forever.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another expresses his opinion and dismay that those in the
main government seat in the nation's capitol drive past this hallowed ground
everyday, &quot;But they either have forgotten why we are here or else they
don't care to remember why we came to this place. We gave our lives for their
beliefs and ideologies. Would any of them wish to trade places with us? I doubt
it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kid from Chicago, an only son of a poor immigrant
Jewish family next speaks. He says he'll never forget how difficult it had been
for his mother to accept the information from the Army representative that he
had been killed - in error, at St. Lo, France, in the bombing by our own U.S.
Army Air Force planes. He spoke, &quot;This new adopted country of ours was to
be our safe haven from persecution in Germany and the start of a new life for
us. My life ended in Normandy.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then my old friend from our post World War Two years of
1947-1949, when we served together in the time honored duty assignment as
Military Escorts, at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, returning the war dead to their
home of record, or a National Cemetery, for burial; John R. Rice, Sergeant First
Class, Infantry, Regular Army, voiced his opinion, to say, &quot;Soldiers don't
win wars, we just fight the battles. Ours is not to reason why. That's what we
do.&quot; This battle-scarred infantry warrior was a full blooded Winnebago
Indian, from Winnebago, Nebraska. He reminded his listeners that it was none
other than President Harry S Truman who signed the Executive Order on June 25,
1950, sending him and his unit, the First Cavalry Division, to fight in Korea.
It happened here, in the fury of battle when John &quot;bought the farm&quot; on
September 11, 1950, in the Pusan Perimeter. No one wanted to tell the truth and
call it a real outright killing war, so they named it a &quot;Police
Action.&quot; John was one of the many of our defenders who paid the ultimate
price and died in battle in a foreign land. Fifty odd years later we still have
over 30,000 men stationed there to act as &quot;peace keepers.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To add to the irony of the moment, Rice, who had escorted
the remains of many of his fallen Indian comrades' home, was then denied burial
in his hometown. It became national shame when the good citizens of Sioux City,
Iowa, refused to permit John's widow to bury him in the local cemetery because
he was not a Caucasian, even though this was his native land. President Truman
then personally directed the Army to bury John here in the Garden of Stone. His
carefully selected place of honor is the grave located between the graves of
General John J. Pershing and General Walton H. Walker. It is only fitting this
native son was laid to rest with the highest military honors at the nation's
most sacred and hallowed ground, among his military peers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the solemn voices had this to say about another
catastrophe. &quot;Why didn't John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson hold off
sending our forces piecemeal into Indo-China as 'military advisors' knowing full
well we were stepping into a quagmire we would learn to regret? Look at what we
lost there, another 58,000 men. Damn, when will we ever learn?&quot; Today, our
&quot;military advisors&quot; span the globe in foreign assignments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The former farm kid from Beebe, Arkansas, in a soft voice
questioned why the guys in college were able to get draft deferments and did not
have to serve like every other draft eligible young American. You know the theme
&quot;Duty, Honor, Country&quot; … or were these just mere words on a wall
someplace on the Hudson River in New York?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The guy who died on the Death March at Bataan was the true
cynic among the voices. Dripping with sarcasm, this is the way he put it,
&quot;Well now, my fellow patriots, who says that they have forgotten us? Don't
they hold an annual Memorial Day service in our honor with speeches and VIPs who
place a floral wreath in the midst of their television high profile coverage to
show they really do remember us - even if for only one day a year? Where is your
appreciation? Why they even have flags placed next to your very own marble
marker to show that you served your country!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The politicians win in the war of words because they are
immune to the casualties of war, whereas the men they knowingly send into battle
will stand-alone when it comes time to make the personal sacrifice. The
politicians survive all verbal battles, while the soldiers will perish. The
latter, as Rice did, are forced to accept this as fait accompli.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is also the Honor Guards of Company A of the 3rd
Infantry Division, the President's Detail. They are quartered in their Fort
Myers, Virginia, barracks polishing their brass accouterments and spit shining
the boots and cap visors. Theirs is a volunteer duty assignment, requiring one
to function like a robot without showing any emotion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The show of sorrow or personal grief can never penetrate
their armor. To do otherwise are grounds for relief from duty and immediate
reassignment. Precision drills, firing squads, folding of the flag and mournful
notes of the Bugler's heart wrenching version of Taps is the repetitious and
mundane routine they practice daily. Another day and another name on a white
marble Stone. Eventually, these elite soldiers transfer and take leave of this
perpetual Garden of Stone, the Valhalla of our warriors. In time, even some of
these career Army men will return here to remain for eternity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A headstone of pristine white marble marks each gravesite
at Arlington. Headstones of those of the Jewish faith are tapered marble shafts
surmounted by a Star of David; stylized crosses mark all others. Annotated on
the headstones of World War I servicemen who could not be identified is:
&quot;HERE RESTS IN HONORED GLORY AN AMERICAN SOLDIER KNOWN ONLY TO GOD.&quot;
The words &quot;AMERICAN SOLDIER&quot; were replaced with the words
&quot;COMRADES IN ARMS&quot; on the headstones of World War II servicemen's
remains who could not be identified because of the tri-service nature of that
war.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Memorial Day services at Arlington are the highlight
of the year, but late in the evening on Mother's Day is when you can listen to
the sounds of the Stones weeping. No, not for themselves, but for the loved ones
of all military personnel whose fate is being decided at this moment by our
leaders in government. After the deadly terrorists' air attacks in New York and
the Pentagon, it has forced the USA, as the only world super power to fill the
role of policemen for the world -- for a long and indefinite period.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the cauldron in the Middle East heats up and threatens
to boil over into another Desert Storm, restraint is the impassioned plea of the
voices of the Garden of Stone. The calculated danger of the inevitable
&quot;mission creep&quot; without a viable exit policy looms on the horizon. The
Stones know all too well from first hand experience that it is just a matter of
time that once the battle is enjoined, others will eventually be sent to join
them here at Arlington's perpetual Garden of Stone. If those who make the
decisions to send men into battle would take a solitary walk among the white
marble Stones on a brilliant moonlit night and stand in the center of this
massive memorial, perhaps they could sense the urgent message and plaintive plea
for everlasting peace.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever there is a severe lightening and thunder storm at
Arlington, the Stones are communicating with Thor, the God of War, who is
angered that we mortals are not listening to His omens, by the way of His
eternal messengers, the Stones. The violent electrical storm serves to punctuate
the foreboding prediction of many more lives that will be lost in the years to
come in search of peace.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the author, Irving Cobb, once said, &quot;If the dead
could return to life, there would be no more wars.&quot;</font></p>

wasn’t too long ago that the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">“Voices”</i>

appear on the horizon that soon after American troops would be sent around the

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">The
Stones’ prophesy of men going to war again was made several years ago, just as
the events in the world were brewing and about to explode in a mid-east
conflict. The liberal press was against our entry into endangered foreign
affairs, but after the events of 9/11 the die was cast and the Pentagon began
burning the midnight oil. The war room machine was getting into high gear --
without a planned long range viable exit strategy.</font></p>

liberal press soon referred to one of the first soldiers’ bodies returned home
as “A Casualty of War” and began a daily press score card of those killed
and wounded. Not to honor those whose lives were lost, but to mount a political
attack on our government’s policy of going to war. So the soldiers, marines,
airmen, sailors and coastguards lost in battle were now just figures on the
national press scoreboard. That is a helluva way to show respect for those who <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">volunteered</i>
to defend freedom; including freedom of the press. Corporal Patrick Tillman,
with a successful career in professional football, when he heard the call to

then Secretary of Defense Les Aspins, under President Clinton, denied Chief of
Staff General Powell’s request for tanks and armored vehicles as a critical
part of Task Force Ranger’s needed fire power for counteracting the AK-47/Kalashnakovs
they would face on the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, it stacked the deck
against the 150 men from Bravo Company, 175<sup>th</sup> Rangers Regiment, Army
Special Operations Command. It resulted in 18 members of Bravo being killed on 3
October 1993, including Army Master Sergeant Gary I. Gordon and Sergeant First
Class Randall D. Shughart; both were awarded the Medal of Honor, posthumously
for their heroic actions above and beyond. Each was given the final tribute paid
to a hero. All 18 men lost in this expedition were dedicated as Casualties of
War; whereas the error made at the Command level should have been described as a
Tragedy of War. Once again, the result of career politicians making
inappropriate military command <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">field </i>decisions.</font></p>

the mean time, those in Congress are wrangling over the dilemma whether to bring
the troops home now as versus those who state the opposite – stay the course.
All well and good, except for the latter, none of those making the decisions for

risking death daily by IEDs and sniper fire. If the troops return now, we lose
face in the <st1:place w:st="on">

Fallujah house to house fighting early on, but the odds caught up with him while
being the first man in the door on a raid looking for insurgents. Destiny placed
him in the wrong place at the wrong time. The blast from a RPJ was the last
flash he saw on this earth; just three months shy of his rotation date. He had
joked with his buddies that he loved the Corps and was determined to reenlist to
become a “lifer” and do the twenty. He was among those laid to rest today.
Soon after the flag was folded and presented to his young widow, the family had
departed, the firing squad marched off, the bugle was cased and silent, the
