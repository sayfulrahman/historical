        in the middle of nowhere, known as the Calais Staging Area. The camp was
        bare-bones no frills temporary establishment out in the boondocks with the bare
        minimum of necessities - tents and out door latrines with a cold water tap.

        of us had retained much of the German Occupational currency we carried when the
        US Postal and Army authorities, without notice, shut down the conduit of
        obtaining Post Money Orders used to ship funds home. The 102<sup>nd</sup>
        Finance Officer would permit us to exchange, but not to exceed, precisely the
        maximum payroll amount we had drawn each month since the inception of the
        Occupational payroll currency. Our payroll records were checked against the
        exchange. This did not include any Occupation currency other than that printed
        by the US Army. The mandatory first digit in the serial number being a numeral
        “1.” Any other Occupation currency was unacceptable. This sum total amount
        was then converted to US dollars; leaving most of us who had dealt on the black
        market stuck holding several hundred dollars of worthless Occupation German
        marks. We greeted new GIs arriving in camp from the States with a fist full of

        next surprise was approving weapons we were bringing home as war trophies. We
        were all assigned to 12 man squad tents with wooden floors containing folding
        canvas cots. At an unannounced early morning roll call, we were ordered to
        standby for an inspection. We called it the “junk-on-the-bunk” routine
        (harassment) by having to empty our duffel bag on the cot. Several officers went
        through everything laid out confiscating all US Army military weapons - mainly
        .45 automatic pistols. If you had a weapon other than an Army issue, you were
        required to declare it a “War Trophy” and register it on a US Customs form,
        witnessed by a 102nd officer, including the manufacturer’s name and the serial
        number of the weapon. I registered my Walther P-38 pistol as a legitimate
        captured enemy weapon. Upon later research, from the serial number I was able to
        determine that the <st1:place w:st="on">

        day I wore it in a shoulder holster under my tank jacket 24/7. I slept with it
        next to my head in my GI army cot. When taking a shower I would ask a trusted
        friend to keep an eye on it and my wallet. GIs are known to steal things.</font>

        be court-martialed and your trip home delayed. No one wanted to risk that and
        items were turned in with no questions asked. We also had to turn in any
        ammunition for the weapons we were permitted to retain. They made this check on

        - only in numbers totaling 308 prisoners. Indicating the POWs had more
        personal room than the American soldier by comparison. It was a small sea going
        vessel measuring 441 feet long, a beam of 57 feet and a draft of 27 feet below
        the water line. The two steam boilers were rated at a top speed maximum 11 knots

    <font face="Arial">There
        was a lot of uncertainty I had to reconcile at the appropriate time. I set it
        all aside and let the world go by, counting my good fortune - I’m a survivor
        coming home, even though it was on a very slow boat. On deck with my thoughts to
        myself, the fresh salt air and sunshine served to clear my head so that I was
        able to take stock of where I had been; in addition to what I had done and where
        I might be headed Rather than be overly concerned with the unforeseeable events
        in the future, I really did not contemplate any long-range thoughts. Not knowing
        what the future would hold (Destiny held all the cards) it all could wait until
        I arrived home and I would sort them all out one by one. The Army had taught me
        what would become a life long problem-solver - “Take ‘em one at a time.”</font>

        served on the line by the cooks who were German POWs. By the noticeable size of
        their well-fed girth, they must have been prisoners for more than a single year.

        the ground, but we didnn’t feel it as we were too emotionally charged by this
        time. I was wound as tight as a drum. As soon as we were assigned quarters and
        fed, they started the paper work mill of processing. Everything had to be
        checked and double-checked; first by the NCOs and then signed off by the
        responsible officer of each section beginning with the medical department,
        supply, personnel and last the finance department. The morning of the 25<sup>th</sup>
        involved more processing, typically everything was done “by-the-numbers” and
        they cut the hurry-up-and-wait time to a minimum in between moving from one
