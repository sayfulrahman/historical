            shot records - no one escaped the final series prior to shipping overseas.
            The rain was coming down in torrents as we sat on our duffel bags and waited
            for the trucks to haul us to the <st1:place w:st="on">

            docks to board our ship for overseas duty - destination unknown. Loose lips

            loaded in the rain into the huge canvas covered trucks while the MPs at the
            gate peered out from their guard-shack as we stared back in silence from the
            tailgate. There were no speeches or brass bands to give us the final farewell;
            before midnight we would be eighty-eight GI replacements about to ship-out.

            assembly point on the docks. The trucks rumbled through highways and streets
            as darkness fell. Before long we arrived at the docks in <st1:place w:st="on">
                Brooklyn</st1:place>
            where our eyes searched for the expected big ocean liner that we would be
            taking us on our sea voyage. The Queen Mary had been converted to a troop ship
            along with many other cruise ocean liners. The vast majority of troops being
            shipped to the European Theater arrived in 5 to 10 days in the faster ships.
            This wasn’t to be -- with our banana boat! To our dismay, they off loaded us
            at the dock and we were told to fall in “by the number” facing the gang
            -plank of this unusually small vessel. I couldn’t believe my eyes - I had
            seen bigger ships sailing on <st1:place w:st="on">

            by armed MPs, after we unloaded from the trucks, we carried our two duffel
            bags to the edge of the dock facing the boat. They double-checked our names
            from rosters then herded us like lemmings up the gangplank to the main deck.
            From there to the third hatch where we were ordered to descend the
            “ladder” (stairs) leading to the midship hold. After a quick glimpse
            around it appeared to be a scene right out of a bad movie. Narrow stretches of
            canvas were laced with rope on the steel frames stacked four high to the
            ceiling with but 24 inches in between the racks. Before long all of us,

            mixed pungent odors of wet wool overcoats and with sweat from a lot of nervous
            armpits and bodies. In the center of the hold, near the ladder separating the
            rows of the stacked canvas racks was the area designated as the Mess Area,
            appropriately so named. It contained tables to stand and eat twice a day with
            a food preparation area adjacent, staffed by the civilian crew.</font>

            were confined below decks, a tug eased us out into the harbor channel and the

            with entertainment, a couple harmonized to sing a duet of several popular love
            songs from the hit play Oklahoma, including “People Will Say We’re In

            with a convoy of some forty odd other cargo ships off the Banks of
            Newfoundland. Our submarine protection consisted of US Navy destroyer escorts
            and Canadian corvettes that constantly circled our large armada of freighters.
            When they dropped depth charges, we hoped that it was a practice run and not
            the real thing. The Commodore’s ship would send signals, using semaphore
            flags and signal lamps keeping radio traffic to a minimum as the convoy began
            the 24-hour zigzag pattern for the full voyage. The rumors were that we were

            as they slid across the decks in the heavy rains and high waves. I thought the

            exit lights near the ladder, our rolling iron coffin gave off an eerie glow. I
            lay there staring at the steel rivets in the ceiling plate twelve inches from
            my face listening to men snore, passing gas, and the ship’s metal plates
            groaning. Some men would talk or moan in their sleep - probably having bad
            nightmares. Waking from their deep sleep, out of habit they would suddenly
            raise up to hit their head on the bottom of the canvas of the man sleeping
            above in the extremely close quarters. If a torpedo did strike our ship we
            were doomed anyway and we knew it. So much for lifeboat mandatory drills.</font>

            throw the perishable decaying food overboard. GIs assigned to KP and cleaning

            first week had passed by very slowly; time seemed to drag with monotony. We
            had freedom of the top deck and many of us spent time staring into space with
            our thoughts of home, or elsewhere, as boredom set in. Some read their Bibles
            or said their Rosaries while others gambled with the non-stop crap games and
            poker table set up. A few of us wrote in our diaries, recording our mundane
            observations. At times it took on the appearance of a floating asylum being
            run by the inmates. When the second week rolled by the tempers became shorter
            and petty quarrels burst into brief fistfights that were quickly broken up by
            cooler heads. On board I soon became friends with a likeable Irishman from the
