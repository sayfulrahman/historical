    <p><strong>DIARY ENTRY #1</strong></p>
    <p><strong>DESTINATION - UNKNOWN</strong></p>
    <p><strong><i>By Don R. Marsh</i></strong></p>
    <p>30 October 1943</p>
    <p>Camp Shanks, New York</p>
    <p>The Army fed us our last stateside dinner then marched us back to the tarpapered
        wooden temporary barracks of Camp Shanks, located near Orangeburg, just north of Tappan in Rockland County in a
        thickly wooded section of scenic suburban New York. Our records had been checked and rechecked multiple times,
        including our
        shot records - no one escaped the final series prior to shipping overseas.
        The rain was coming down in torrents as we sat on our duffel bags and waited
        for the trucks to haul us to the Brooklyn docks to board our ship for overseas duty - destination unknown. Loose
        lips
        sink ships and they kept us totally in the dark about where we were headed.
        The rumor mill was working overtime.

    </p>
    <p>
        We loaded in the rain into the huge canvas covered trucks while the MPs at the
        gate peered out from their guard-shack as we stared back in silence from the
        tailgate. There were no speeches or brass bands to give us the final farewell;
        before midnight we would be eighty-eight GI replacements about to ship-out.
        About same time, trucks from nearby Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, were enroute bringing the other half our
        contingent to meet us at the same
        assembly point on the docks. The trucks rumbled through highways and streets
        as darkness fell. Before long we arrived at the docks in Brooklyn where our eyes searched for the expected big
        ocean liner that we would be
        taking us on our sea voyage. The Queen Mary had been converted to a troop ship
        along with many other cruise ocean liners. The vast majority of troops being
        shipped to the European Theater arrived in 5 to 10 days in the faster ships.
        This wasn’t to be -- with our banana boat! To our dismay, they off loaded us
        at the dock and we were told to fall in “by the number” facing the gang
        -plank of this unusually small vessel. I couldn’t believe my eyes - I had
        seen bigger ships sailing on Lake Michigan!
    </p>
    <p>
        Flanked by armed MPs, after we unloaded from the trucks, we carried our two duffel
        bags to the edge of the dock facing the boat. They double-checked our names
        from rosters then herded us like lemmings up the gangplank to the main deck.
        From there to the third hatch where we were ordered to descend the
        “ladder” (stairs) leading to the midship hold. After a quick glimpse
        around it appeared to be a scene right out of a bad movie. Narrow stretches of
        canvas were laced with rope on the steel frames stacked four high to the
        ceiling with but 24 inches in between the racks. Before long all of us,
        including the New Jersey late arrivals, were in the “quarters” as the hole became filled with the
        mixed pungent odors of wet wool overcoats and with sweat from a lot of nervous
        armpits and bodies. In the center of the hold, near the ladder separating the
        rows of the stacked canvas racks was the area designated as the Mess Area,
        appropriately so named. It contained tables to stand and eat twice a day with
        a food preparation area adjacent, staffed by the civilian crew.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first soldiers down into the hold immediately grabbed the lowest bunks of the
        four. A decision they would all later regret. Based on my brother Ed’s sage
        advice, a Navy First Class Gunner’s Mate, I made a beeline for the top bunk,
        in anticipation of those below me becoming seasick and the danger of being
        splattered with their undigested food, as it was sure to happen and did, once
        we hit open water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We didn’t
        have long to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometime before midnight, without a farewell glimpse of the Statue of Liberty as we
        were confined below decks, a tug eased us out into the harbor channel and the
        gentle rocking began. My thoughts turned to this evening’s planned date with
        a very attractive 21-year-old Jewish gal, a strawberry blond, whom I recently
        had met in New York. She would be left waiting for me tonight at the cigar counter of the Waldorf
        Astoria Hotel, as she told me later, wondering what happened to me. Although
        she knew I was pending overseas orders any day, neither of us had expected my
        sudden departure this soon and had made a date for tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
        We had previously met at the Roseland Ballroom during one of my earlier passes to the
        city and found ourselves attracted to each other after our first dance. I
        would like to claim that I swept her off her feet, but the truth is that I
        didn’t step on her toes but once. I had to take the commuter bus into the
        city and she worked in a mid-town office, so after work we met at the
        conveniently located landmark - the Astoria cigar stand.
    </p>
    <p>
        On what
        turned out to be our last date, we spent most of the evening at a piano bar
        called “Number One Club on Fifth Avenue” drinking Canadian Club whiskeys where afterwards some anonymous
        civilian
        then picked up my tab; but not before we both got well oiled. We had arrived
        early enough to get a table before the place became packed. Being a nightspot
        with entertainment, a couple harmonized to sing a duet of several popular love
        songs from the hit play Oklahoma, including “People Will Say We’re In
        Love” which provided the romantic mood for us. Love was most certainly in
        the air.
    </p>
    <p>
        She
        lived with her family in the Bronx on Mosholu Parkway, so in escorting her home we took the “A Train” to
        someplace near the
        Grand Concourse, as I recall. Her parents were asleep when we arrived, but her
        brother came home later, just as we were in our final embrace of saying
        goodnight, where we were then introduced. Naturally I got lost on the train(s)
        returning to catch my bus stop for the bus back to camp.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even
        with gentle rocking of the boat I found that I was unable to sleep, so I
        closed my eyes to recall these pleasant moments with her just as the ship’s
        twin steam boilers kicked in. The boat began the non-stop vibrations that
        never ceased until we touched dry land again. I would write after we landed
        and explain the cancellation of our plans that night, which she fully
        understood.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ship was headed for foreign lands -- “exciting unknown places” we had read
        about as high school kids, which some of us had been studying only a year or
        two ago. Tonight, the former high school kids, some not old enough to vote
        were men going off to war. Many on board would not be among those making a
        return trip to the USA two years later. It was out of our control and up to a higher authority from
        this point forward and the fortunes of war.
    </p>
    <p>
        Except
        for a recent casual acquaintance or two, most of us in the eighty-eight were
        total strangers drawn from two separate Signal Corps training centers. I
        received my training at Camp Crowder, Missouri while others came from Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Most of us were
        Field Wire Basic (MOS 641) soldiers, although we had a
        scattering of radio operators, radio repairmen and truck drivers. It was
        explained to us by the five unassigned replacement officers also on board,
        including one a medical officer, that we were part of a test for the Army
        Transportation Corps to determine if it were feasible to transport troops, in
        small numbers, aboard primary cargo ships combined with carrying freight. As
        far as the guinea pigs GIs were concerned, it was a dismal failure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Painted
        a dull gray with the only port holes visible above deck; we knew this boat was
        far from being a cruise ship. By the time we arrived at our destination, we
        nick named it the “Ship From Hell” - the Liberty ship the George Sharswood.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was built in the Bethlehem-Fairchild Shipyards Baltimore, Maryland, in 1942, on
        hull #0945. It measured 441 feet long and 56 feet wide with a depth of 37
        feet; it could carry 9,000 tons of cargo below decks and additional cargo on
        deck. Some other Liberty ships were built specifically as army transport carried 550 troops without
        cargo. Its speed was a maximum 11
        knots, if the screws of the single propeller remained in the water long
        enough, but they seldom did. The armament was six 20 mm machine guns on the
        bridge, two 37 mm bow guns and a 4” cannon on the stern. This ancient stern
        piece still bore the brass plaque on its side that said it was on loan,
        reclaimed from a public park in the City of Philadelphia and was manufactured in 1903. The Navy sailors on board
        refused to test fire
        it for fear it might burst the barrel! A
        US Navy armed guard crew, ranging upwards from 12 men and one officer, manned
        the weapons. The ship contained five holds, three forward and two aft. The
        crew of 44 civilian Merchant Marine seamen operated the ship. On the bridge
        were four 25-man lifeboats, two per side. The lifeboats were designated for
        the crewmen only and “Off Limits” to all soldiers. The Army personnel were
        instructed not to use the lifeboats in the drills, but were relegated to
        wooden structured kapok filled life rafts. In the event we had to abandon
        ship, the life expectancy in those frigid waters in a life raft would have
        been but a few short hours due to hypothermia.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Liberty ship rocked and rolled through the swells as we headed north to rendezvous
        with a convoy of some forty odd other cargo ships off the Banks of
        Newfoundland. Our submarine protection consisted of US Navy destroyer escorts
        and Canadian corvettes that constantly circled our large armada of freighters.
        When they dropped depth charges, we hoped that it was a practice run and not
        the real thing. The Commodore’s ship would send signals, using semaphore
        flags and signal lamps keeping radio traffic to a minimum as the convoy began
        the 24-hour zigzag pattern for the full voyage. The rumors were that we were
        headed for Sicily in time for the Invasion of Italy; dreamers said we were headed for the Caribbean to enjoy the
        palm trees and rum and colas. The pragmatists, myself included,
        guessed we were headed for England to join the BIG ONE - the Invasion of France.
    </p>
    <p>
        Crossing
        the north Atlantic in November in the rough seas even on board a cruise liner
        is not a pleasant experience - in a small Liberty ship, a nightmare. Off the Iceland Coast, we ran into
        gale-force storms with extremely heavy 30-40 foot seas. The deck
        cargo of high-test gasoline in 55 gallon drums broke loose becoming a danger
        as they slid across the decks in the heavy rains and high waves. I thought the
        pitching would swamp the ship as it plowed through the deep troughs between
        massive waves.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had lookout duty on the bridge with the US Navy gun crew on the 20mm
        antiaircraft guns, but it was all I could do to hang onto the ship’s rail.
        As this was the first trip for the young sailors fresh out of the Great Lakes
        Naval Training Center at Waukegan, Illinois, they turned sea sick green, as
        did my landlubber Army friends. I was one of the few who did not become sea
        sick the whole voyage, but that didn’t make me wish I had enlisted in the
        Navy, as did my brother Ed, rather than the Army.
    </p>
    <p>
        I spent
        as little time below decks as I possibly could by making friends with the
        sailors topside. All of them, except their mustang Ensign and one Gunner’s
        Mate First Class, had trained at the Great Lakes Naval Center, less than 30
        miles from my hometown, Racine, Wisconsin. I learned some had taken shore
        leave in Racine after finishing boot camp before attending gunnery school.
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        ship was a water-bound prison. At night after lights out, deep in the sleeping
        compartment of the hold, in the semi-darkness illuminated by only the six red
        exit lights near the ladder, our rolling iron coffin gave off an eerie glow. I
        lay there staring at the steel rivets in the ceiling plate twelve inches from
        my face listening to men snore, passing gas, and the ship’s metal plates
        groaning. Some men would talk or moan in their sleep - probably having bad
        nightmares. Waking from their deep sleep, out of habit they would suddenly
        raise up to hit their head on the bottom of the canvas of the man sleeping
        above in the extremely close quarters. If a torpedo did strike our ship we
        were doomed anyway and we knew it. So much for lifeboat mandatory drills.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each
        day became more depressing as the conditions on board worsened. For whatever
        reason, our fresh food rations in the walk-in coolers became spoiled and were
        uneatable, requiring the Army medical officer to order the civilian cook to
        throw the perishable decaying food overboard. GIs assigned to KP and cleaning
        out the cold storage lockers were forced to use their gas masks the stench was
        so bad. Until the air cleared, the smells from the rotten food added to the
        fetid odor of the men’s unwashed soiled clothing. It became so unbearable
        that it contributed to more men with weak stomachs running for the rails.
        After the first experience of being unable to get a lather from the soap and
        salt water, no one was interested in any further salt-water showers and each
        passing day made hygienic conditions worse.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first week had passed by very slowly; time seemed to drag with monotony. We
        had freedom of the top deck and many of us spent time staring into space with
        our thoughts of home, or elsewhere, as boredom set in. Some read their Bibles
        or said their Rosaries while others gambled with the non-stop crap games and
        poker table set up. A few of us wrote in our diaries, recording our mundane
        observations. At times it took on the appearance of a floating asylum being
        run by the inmates. When the second week rolled by the tempers became shorter
        and petty quarrels burst into brief fistfights that were quickly broken up by
        cooler heads. On board I soon became friends with a likeable Irishman from the Boston area; actually he came
        from Brighton, not far from my paternal grandfather’s
        home in Dedham. His name was Lawrence A. Hull; we hit it off and later became foxhole
        buddies as fate determined our future.

        All portholes and doorways were covered with blackout material to avoid detection
        by the German submarine wolf packs that roamed the Atlantic for their prey, sending hundreds of ships and crews
        to their death. We were
        constantly made aware of the ever-present danger by drills and calls to
        General Quarters. You never knew if it was only a drill or the real thing, so
        you strictly followed orders by the number. The blackout was carefully
        observed by all, crew and passengers alike for our own safety. One moonless
        night off on the horizon we witnessed a scene as though it was a mirage. A
        white ship totally ablaze with lights from bow to stern was steaming westward
        to the USA, apparently a hospital ship carrying wounded from the recently completed
        Sicily Invasion. I was amazed that the German U-boat captains observed the
        international neutrality for the Red Cross ships.
    </p>
    <p>
        We were now beginning our <b><i>nineteenth</i></b>
        day at sea, November 17<sup>th</sup>, when the lookouts spotted land off on
        the horizon. The word spread like wild fire as every man raced to the deck
        rail for a better view. It was land - lots and lots of it became visible
        assuring us it was not an island, but someplace. By then, anyplace was
        acceptable. Soon came the word over the ship’s loudspeakers that we would be
        docking at the Firth of Clyde Docks, Glasgow, Scotland. So this was the “Promised Land” - we made it! The lush
        green hills
        came into sight, giving many of us a touch of homesickness after almost three
        weeks at sea.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then reality set in and we received the first of many surprises, but not before the
        pleasant experience of being greeted by American Red Cross lady volunteers
        passing out hot coffee and doughnuts. Even the guys still nursing queasy
        stomachs wolfed down the warm greasy doughnuts as though they were their
        mother’s homemade cake. The party was over and it was time to line up by the
        numbers, check off names and load on to British Railways Systems funny looking
        cars that would take us down south to the Birmingham, England rail yards. The
        trip gave us a good opportunity to study the rolling hills and British
        countryside as we passed through the “quaint” small villages and towns.
    </p>
    <p>
        Arriving at the rail head late in the evening, we were met by the big GI trucks and
        headed to our next destination - the infamous American 10<sup>th</sup> US
        Army Replacement Depot, APO 7245, NY, NY, at Litchfield, England, the former home of the British North
        Staffordshire Regiment, once known as
        the Whittington Barracks. The ancient red brick buildings were a warm welcome
        after the long sea voyage. The next week Thanksgiving Day arrived and we were
        treated to the usual turkey dinner with all the trimmings in the traditional
        Army fare. Those who asked were given passes to visit the nearby towns, but
        much like Cinderella, the six hour pass ended at midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our small contingent of men was assigned to Company “C”, 438 Battalion, 10<sup>th</sup>
        Replacement Depot. While waiting to draw assignments, we were once again
        subjected to routine gas mask drill, close order drill and a formal retreat
        ceremony required every night - seven days a week - performed for the
        personal pleasure of the Post Commander, Colonel Frances Killian, as we passed
        in review before him.
    </p>
    <p>
        December arrived along with our marching orders. Our shipmates were split up at this
        time. Some of the men -- Leo Walls, Johnny Rossi and Jim Magruder, among
        others, were sent to join the 101<sup>st</sup> Airborne Division and would
        become “legs” - non-jumpers. But most of our 88 were assigned to the 143<sup>rd</sup>
        Armored Signal Company of the Third Armored Division, located on a remote
        former mushroom farm near the village of Cucklington, outside Warminster in Somerset County west of London.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Spearhead Division bound included Privates Norman W. Steele (KIA); William
        Emerson (WIA); Gerald P. Morey; Edward J. Robitaille; Frances B. Grow; William
        T. Hatry (POW) Robert Rosenberg (KIA); Kenneth C. Speers (WIA); Harry I.
        Tuttle; Lowell P. Dillard (KIA); James D, Matthews (WIA); Stanley R. Presgrave;
        Lawrence A. Hull; Frank Ruffalo; Gerald Fein; Don R. Marsh and Sergeant Herman
        Moeller. (WIA)
    </p>
    <p>KIA = Killed In Action WIA = Wounded In Action POW = Prisoner of War</p>
    <p>
        The saga of the long sea voyage had terminated and a whole new chapter in our lives was
        about to open in the next few months as the on-coming Second Front with the
        Invasion of France was building to a crescendo. The winds of war were
        gathering among the rising storm clouds. We would not have long to wait to
        meet our fait accompli.
