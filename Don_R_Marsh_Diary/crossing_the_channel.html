  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The call was made to “mount
  your vehicles” – it was the moment we had trained for over the past months
  and years. We are actually and literally going to war. Our convoy stretched
  out for miles as we pulled out of the gates of the Tidworth Army Garrison like
  the lemmings headed down to the sea. Our destination was the docks at <st1:place w:st="on">

  . The folks in the villages and small towns turned out to wave and give us the
  “V” for victory sign. Many old soldiers saluted as we passed their row
  homes and the women said, “God Bless and good luck, Yanks.” Both we and
  they were well aware that we would never pass this way again. It was a
  sobering moment in all of our lives.</p>

  had removed our 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division shoulder insignia and the unit
  identification on the vehicles, for secrecy, but everyone within 100 miles
  knew the 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division was on the move; if they couldn’t
  see us they could sure hear us. The D-Day landings had occurred two days prior

  <st1:place w:st="on">

  guides were posted directing the traffic to prearranged locations for loading
  “by the numbers” with designated ships. Vehicles were backed into the
  cavernous hull of the LSTs in assigned positions of disembarkation. Nothing
  was being left to chance. Our communications group vehicles were sandwiched in
  between the Sherman and Stuart tanks and half tracks from the 66<sup>th</sup>
  Armored Regiment, 2AD.</p>

  <st1:place w:st="on">

  were present to take photos of the men and ships being loaded on the LSTs. A
  photographer from the Boston Globe asked my buddy Larry Hull to take his photo
  on the deck; the photo then appeared in the Boston Globe, Larry’s hometown
  newspaper. A copy of the photo was sent to his parents residing in <st1:place 
w:st="on">
  Brighton</st1:place>
  and later when I saw the copy, I asked him what in the hell he had to smile
  about -- at that moment! No one from the Racine Journal Times was present so I
  didn’t get my picture in the newspaper or even a mention on page 26.</p>

  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">When our vehicles were fully
  loaded aboard the LST the skies darkened as the late afternoon rains
  threatened. We were confined <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">below
  decks</i></b> for the remainder of the sea voyage across the <st1:place w:st="on">
  English Channel</st1:place>
  . There was no one there to see us off, wave goodbye or say, “bon voyage.”
  On the contrary, the Channel was being prowled by German u-boats that had
  already taken its toll in the White Sands pre-invasion exercises. Our
  destroyers and sub-chaser corvettes were searching and dropping ash cans of
  explosives in areas of suspect. Not a very comforting thought to those of us
  locked down below inside the iron coffin. One torpedo into that tub and we
  would sink to the bottom as other unfortunates had suffered; including a 2<sup>nd</sup>
  Armored Division LST attempting to land in the Sicily Invasion, in July 1943,
  with loss of life. The ship’s rocking motion and engines kicking in told me
  that we were leaving the dock and headed out to open sea. The final journey of
  a lifetime for some had begun.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Some men remained on or in
  their vehicles. I chose to find a spot on the catwalk that lined the outer
  shell of the ship to be alone; there I found a gray British army blanket
  someone had left behind the day before. This was now time for my serious
  personal and private thoughts. Ironic – a private with private thoughts, if
  only the Army knew! Unknown to me at that very moment, but one of my high
  school classmates, Jack Heegeman, who had came ashore on D-Day with an
  Engineer unit was assigned to clearing the obstacles on the beach head. We
  were informed that our initial landing forces of V Corps under command of
  Major General Leonard T. Gerow, had suffered heavy causalities in the landing
  area assigned to us – <st1:place w:st="on">

  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The selected stretch of Omaha
  Red Easy beach was 7,000 yards long with a crescent curved shoreline with
  cliffs at each end of the sector. It had a tidal range of 18 feet expected
  during the assault, with the low tide exposing firm sand for about 300 yards
  from high to the low watermark. The Germans had installed mined underwater
  obstacles all along this tidal flat. The beach main Exit Draw was identified
  as E-D1. Hopefully, our Allied D-Day landing troops had pushed far enough
  inland to establish a defensible beach head, enabling us to land without
  sustaining heavy casualties from expected artillery fire. The beach head was
  far from being totally secure. Rommel had a huge arsenal of tanks at his
  disposal to throw at us at any time of his choosing. Fortunately for us,
  Hitler prevented Rommel from unleashing his Panzers, whose sheer numbers would
  have devastated and over-whelmed us – creating another possible <st1:City w:st="on">

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">At a time like this it was
  for each person to find his own comfort and solace. I watched as one of our
  troops held his rosary in his hands, his head bowed in silent prayer. My
  thoughts were of my family, in particular my Irish mother who had a difficult
  life raising her seven children, at times alone; my brother Ed, serving in the
  Pacific with the Navy as a Gunner’s Mate 1st/Class and my other brothers and
  sisters still at home.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Thoughts turned to my father
  and his military experiences, who at the age of 41 in World War One, with a
  wife and three children, volunteered for the Illinois National Guard to serve
  once again as an Infantry Sergeant. This time with Company “I” of the 132<sup>nd</sup>
  Infantry Regiment, 66<sup>th</sup> Brigade of the 33<sup>rd</sup> Infantry
  Division in the Meuse –Argonne, Somme offensive in 1918 in <st1:country-region

  wrapped the Brit’s abandoned blanket around me and reflected on my life up
  to that point of what had transpired in my 21 years on this earth. As for
  tomorrow, the fear of the unknown remained in the subconscious; the future
  being impossible to predict, so I didn’t dwell on it. Trusting in Fate, my
  Destiny on earth was already predetermined. Instead, I counted my blessings
  and reminisced.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I grew up in poverty in The
  Great Depression in a small <st1:place 
w:st="on">
  Midwest</st1:place>
  industrial hick town, but managed to graduate from high school while most of
  my friends dropped out for a variety of reasons. While in high school, I had
  met my first and only true love. Her name was Phyllis – she became my high
  school sweetheart for all three years.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I closed my eyes and recalled
  how she would ride her bicycle to our house, whistle loudly and then coyly
  duck behind the huge oak tree out front to wait for me. My father would call
  me and say, “Donnie, your little Italian girl friend is here.” I could
  still picture her laughing and hiding behind the old oak. Those were the best
  of times and those were the worst of times.</p>

  shore line. In the winter we would ice skate on the frozen zoo pond. She was
  in both my French classes for two years. Probably the reason I took those
  elective classes! She was very popular with a winning smile and a great sense
  of humor. She was awarded her “letter” in volleyball despite being not
  quite 5 feet tall. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>

  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Then she graduated in 1940
  and moved out of state; with that my whole world changed. We lost contact, but
  I never stopped thinking about her. Others would come along, but none ever
  replaced her. Though I often wondered what became of her I was not aware that
  she was employed at the <st1:PlaceName

  lives.</p>

  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">A sudden jolt shook me from
  my reverie. The bow of the ship was on the beach. In the crossing we lost one
  LST that hit a floating mine and sunk with loss of life. Our LST obviously
  maneuvered through the minefields, following the shore beacons from the Beach
  Master’s signal lamps which guided the ship on to the shoreline. There
  wasn’t any sandy beach visible where we beached, but it didn’t matter. We
  were beached! Of course we were still confined below decks and had no
  knowledge of the shoreline nor the history making massive flotilla of naval
  warships surrounding the landing areas.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">The night time hours dragged
  by, while we continued to be locked below decks. Now it was waiting until the
  tide receded and we would off load at the first light of day break. German
  aircraft were heard droning overhead and dropping lethal bomb loads. The near
  misses would rock the ship and we knew they were not finished bombing for the
  night, as others followed with their bomb runs. The ships anti-aircraft guns
  hammered throughout the night with the empty brass shell casings from the
  Bofors’ guns landing “plink-plink” on the steel decking of our LST. That
  is when the adrenaline began flowing! Orders were to remain in place and
  grumbles could be heard among the men, but strangely there was a lack of
  conversation. What could be said that made sense anyway?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We knew we were sitting ducks without any recourse.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Daylight broke and the bow
  doors opened and the ramp lowered. Veno got behind the wheel of the jeep with
  its top down, with windshield covered and lashed to the hood. I took my seat
  next to him. The vehicles belching fumes started rolling down the ramp on to
  the beach. Our turn came at the top of the ramp and as I looked out over the
  front of our jeep, all I could see was water in front of us! We were 30 yards
  from dry land!</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">We had been assigned to
  transport a temporary back seat passenger, a non-member of our wire team, a
  switchboard operator, who was a young Jewish private from <st1:State w:st="on">
  <st1:place w:st="on">
  New York</st1:place>
  </st1:State>
  . He was so damn nervous that he kept turning around on the small back jump
  seat and each time he turned, the barrel of his carbine struck Veno in the
  back of his helmet. Veno at this point a bit edgy himself, although a veteran
  of North Africa and Sicily, said, “The next God damn time you hit me with
  your fucking carbine I am going to take it away and ram it up your ass.” The
  frightened <st1:State w:st="on">
  <st1:place w:st="on">
  New York</st1:place>
  </st1:State>
  guy sat motionless the rest of the way, except I saw that he had already
  pissed his pants and his crotch bore the tell-tale wet stain. Often wondered
  what scared him, Veno or the sight of all that water? Or both?</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p>
  &nbsp;</o:p>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Veno eased the jeep down the
  ramp and into the water. It had to be three or more feet in depth. I believe
  we managed to get five feet from the edge of the LST bow ramp when the engine
  sputtered and died. The coil shorted out and refused to start as Veno ground
  the starter. The water-proofing did not hold and there we sat. But, not for
  long. The Beach Master had a huge caterpillar tractor on standby for just such
  a malfunction. The Cat operator snagged a chain on to the front bumper and
  towed us on to the shore. We lifted the hood, removed the water proof
  material, dried the coil and took off to chase the tail end of the vehicles
  leaving the LST.</p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Our
  destination was the wooded area near Mosles where we rendezvoused with the
  command and prepared to meet the boss – Brigadier General Maurice Rose,
  Combat Command “A” Commanding Officer; who had been ashore since early
  morning on June 7<sup>th</sup>, conferring with the Corps commander’s
  staffs. By midnight, June 9<sup>th</sup>, 86 officers and 1,581 men and their
