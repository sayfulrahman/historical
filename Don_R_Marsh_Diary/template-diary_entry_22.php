<p>
    <font face="Arial">7 April 1945&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">Suhl, Germany</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He slowly opened his eyes and said, &quot;I ain't dead
        yet, you son of a bitch!&quot; Those were the last words he remembered before
        the effects of the morphine syrette kicked in and darkness overcame him. This
        was just as a fellow GI began to remove his combat boots, as he lay wounded on a
        stretcher on the hood of the medical jeep with severe pain from his gunshot
        wound to his shoulder and back. At first, he thought the guy taking off his
        boots was performing an act of kindness in trying to make him comfortable. Then
        to his astonishment he realized that the low-life bastard was stealing his
        boots, leaving him shoeless! Although they were ready to give him up for dead,
        he lived to fool them all one more time. His anger and determination to live
        helped carry himself over another hurdle in life.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orphaned at an early age and growing up in my hometown of
        Racine, Wisconsin, I met this tough street-wise teen-ager one day when my older
        brother Bob brought him home to stay with us. Even though we were struggling in
        the midst of The Great Depression of the 1930s, our Irish Catholic mother never
        turned away a stranger in need and Gordy became &quot;family.&quot;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the pain killing drugs wore off, he kept playing it
        over and over again in his mind. This time he ran it in slow motion, almost one
        frame at a time, as if it was a series of stop action still photos and picture
        clear, recapping the exact sequences leading up to the moment the bullet
        impacted him. He was the point man leading his squad. When without warning, he
        heard the shot fired, being so close to the unseen shooter, in the house- to-
        house fighting in the German village. In that millisecond instant when he felt
        the bullet smash into his left shoulder he felt the searing hot pain that spun
        him around as his legs buckled. His arms and legs became entangled with each
        other, as he fell to the cobble-stoned street in front of the house. His Garand
        M-1 rifle flew out of his hands and clattered to the ground, as he was unable to
        break his fall. When he hit the ground his helmet flew off as he recalled
        looking up and staring at the gray sky, bareheaded and feeling naked without his
        rifle and helmet.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;God, damn it, I got it again,&quot; he thought.
        Another Purple Heart -- only this time he knew he was busted up inside pretty
        bad, far worse than last time.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest of his infantry squad scattered to take cover for
        fear the Kraut would pick off another member of this armored infantry company in
        the lead of the attack on this cross roads village. He had no recollection how
        long he laid there, out in the open, unaided. What seemed like forever, an
        unknown amount of time passed as the ensuing firefight raged in taking the
        barricaded houses one by one at the intersection from the enemy defenders.
        Finally, his own cry of &quot;Medic&quot; was heard and the kid they had named
        &quot;Doc&quot; ran out to where he lay twisted, where he had fallen. Carefully
        rolling him on to his side, Doc found the blood spurting from the shoulder and
        back of his combat jacket. The bullet had entered the shoulder muscle mass and
        had exited from his back. It was a clean through and through shot smashing
        everything, bone and muscle in its exit path.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;How bad is it?&quot; he asked Doc. The medic
        answered, &quot;You're going stateside.&quot; Translated to GI unspoken terms,
        &quot; if you make it!&quot; The Doc dug into his bag and began applying
        compresses to staunch the flow of blood, but the internal damage was his main
        concern and worried him the most. They would have to move fast to get him to an
        aid station for a medical doctor to take over as soon as possible, before he
        went into cardiac arrest from loss of blood and shock. A second medic appeared
        with a stretcher taken from their infantry half-track. They carefully lifted him
        gingerly onto to the canvas between the two poles. Placing him on the stretcher
        rack on the hood of their medical jeep they went back to pick up another
        seriously wounded man for the fast trip to the collection point and aid station.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Doc had given him a shot from the morphine syrette and
        it had started to take effect and put him out of it. His mind raced to recall
        the events that occurred just prior to the moment he heard that distinctive
        crack of a rifle fired from yards away. Just seconds before his mind went blank
        from the drugs, he saw the American soldier approaching the foot of his
        stretcher. Without saying a word, the soldier started unbuckling the tops of his
        combat boots, to remove them, as though they were a prized possession instead of
        issue GI boots. Now we have all heard of scum in our own Army who would steal
        from a corpse, but this live body contained the heart and soul of a street
        fighter, who didn't know the meaning of the word quit. When the drug
        over-powered his mind and rendered him unable to fight back, he became totally
        helpless and also shoeless.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stops at the various aid stations and evacuation
        points were all a blur in his memory. He only could recall the first stop where
        they stripped away his clothing and then it became dark all over again. Unknown
        voices, motions, movements when he finally came out of the fog, he asked the
        Army nurse, &quot;Where am I?&quot; Back came her standard reply, &quot;You're
        in England, soldier.&quot; He was now a patient at US Army Hospital, Plant
        #4150, APO #63, NY. It was April 10, 1945. The long journey home and the painful
        recuperation and rehabilitation were about to begin. Receiving his first Purple
        Heart Medal awarded after being wounded at Metz, France, he was briefly
        hospitalized and was soon returned to duty in time to fight in the Battle of the
        Bulge. However, that would not be the case this time. With the war winding down,
        he had almost made it until this happened. Like many other friends of mine in
        the Army, April was the unlucky month, among them, Gil Lindgren and Norm Steele.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While recovering from his surgery he tried to put the
        pieces back together and let his mind replay the events over and over
        repeatedly. He recalled that he had tried to tell his new replacement platoon
        officer that the village was perfectly situated for a Kraut rear guard defense.
        By now it was well known that the fanatical teenage Hitler Youth were fighting a
        desperate delaying action all across the front, refusing to surrender until they
        ran out of ammunition. His apprehension fell on deaf ears as the new Lieutenant
        led his first combat patrol and was eager to impress his superiors with his
        newly learned leadership skills.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was early April 1945, with all the US armored divisions
        hell bent to reach Berlin first, pushing the Krauts into the hordes of Russians
        intent upon doing the same thing. - reaching Berlin. The assignment for Company
        &quot;B&quot;, 63rd Armored Infantry Battalion, 11th Armored Division, was the
        German village of Suhl. Just one more meaningless Kraut town to capture, in the
        final rat race that would bring us closer to returning home.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our soldier was Private First Class Farrell Gordon
        Schoedel, Regular Army, Serial Number 7032333, hometown, Racine, Wisconsin.
        Gordy, as he preferred, was another of my friends I grew up with from the old
        north side neighborhood. He was on the wild side and with an attitude, as were
        most teenagers I knew during that period of time. Those were hard times and it
        drew out the hardness in good people, too, in order to survive. He had that wry
        smile and &quot;that devil may care look&quot; in his eyes that was deceptive.
        Depending on the gender of the person he was addressing, the look could
        expressly convey the thought &quot;Well, do you want to frolic, fight or run a
        foot race? Take your pick. I'm ready for whatever comes up.&quot;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gordy was involved in a lot of fights with that attitude.
        Often his explanation was a shrug of his shoulders and a laugh. More often as
        not, Gordy gave as good as he got, while coming out the winner. Gordy was on the
        small side of average; about 5 foot 6 inches, about 140 pounds, including beer.
        As often as he was tested, he could take a punch and gained the reputation for
        being able to punch equally well with both hands. The guy had balls plus a fair
        share of scar tissue around both eyes as souvenirs from brawls. And so did a lot
        of other guys bigger than he was after meeting Gordy mano-mano.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recalling his last conversation with the new Lieutenant
        after the briefing that fateful day, they learned the &quot;B&quot; Company
        would lead off the attack and their platoon had &quot;the honors.&quot; Gordy
        was the only member from his platoon to voice his opinion that his platoon got
        the shaft once more to lead off. For popping off, the Lieutenant glared at him
        and said, &quot;Soldier, you take the point when we move out.&quot; Conversation
        ended.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though a Private, Gordy was the senior ranking member in
        &quot;B&quot; Company from the Old Army standpoint of payroll protocol. In
        keeping with the Old Army tradition, all Regular Army men, regardless of rank,
        were paid first in the pay line at the pay table, in front of men with the
        wartime ranks of First Sergeant and all other &quot;First Three Graders&quot;
        (Master, Tech and Staff) thereby making him a marked man in the eyes of
        superiors of both ranks. He was the classic screw up resulting in infrequent
        promotions and reductions in repeated summary court-martials for minor
        infractions and off duty run ins with the MPs in town. On post without alcohol,
        he was the perfect soldier. Off post was trouble. Our paths in the Army crossed
        on 16 January 1945, when our two armored divisions, the 2nd and the 11th, linked
        up and closed off the salient separating the northern First Army and the
        southern Third Army at Houffalize, Belgium, in the frozen snow drifts of the
        Eiffel Mountains in the Ardennes Forrest, ending the Battle of the Bulge.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We met again after the war in our hometown favorite
        neighborhood watering hole when I returned home. He had been finally discharged
        from the Battle Creek, Michigan, Army Hospital Rehab Center. I greeted him with
        a facetious remark, &quot;Gordy, my little hero, tell me how you got shot in the
        back?&quot; Which I knew would drive him up the wall -- questioning his courage.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instantly, &quot;that look&quot; came over his face and
        his piercing eyes focused on me for a brief moment, when I saw his wicked smile
        spreading as he said, &quot;You miserable so-and-so, Don! Nice to see you too
        again. We both made it home alive. The first drink is on me. Ain't we the lucky
        ones!&quot;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gordy died May 3, 1970 at the age of fifty, but he had
        cheated the Grim Reaper out of the 25 years since April 10, 1945, so once again
        he broke even in the books. Tonight I'm sure he's in Valhalla searching for that
        low-life-scum-bag who stole his boots. I know once he finds him, he'll give him
        &quot;that look&quot; just before he belts him.</font>
