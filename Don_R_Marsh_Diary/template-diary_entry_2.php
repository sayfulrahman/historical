    <h1 class="center"><b>THE 143<sup>RD</sup> SIGNAL NEW MEN</b></h1>
    <p><em>By Don R. Marsh</em></p>
    <p>December 1943</p>
    <p>Cucklington, England</p>
    <p>The 143<sup>rd</sup> Armored Signal Company was under the command of
        Captain John L. Wilson, Jr., a stern disciplinarian of the first order. I will
        not attempt to render a biased opinion here, but I was not alone in the
        evaluation of the man, with the power of life and death, that he was unfit for
        command. Captain Wilson had been with the Signal Company since its inception
        beginning as a Second Lieutenant with a ROTC commission. Even his fellow
        officers in the Company disliked him. The rest of the officers, decent men,
        were Captain Edward P. Woolcock; 1<sup>st</sup> Lt. Hugh B. Parker; 1<sup>st</sup>
        Lt. Charles A. Webb, Jr.; 1<sup>st</sup> Lt. George C. McCain; 1<sup>st</sup>
        Lt. Robert L. Milnes; 1<sup>st</sup> Lt. Donald B. Sanborn; 1<sup>st</sup> Lt.
        Roy C. Pedersen; 1<sup>st</sup> Lt. Robert Riensche; 1<sup>st</sup> Lt. Donald
        C. Willis; 1<sup>st</sup> Lt. James Reddeck; 1<sup>st</sup> Lt. Charles F.
        Young and WOJG Joseph H. Demico.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shortly
        after our arrival, at the first full Company formation, Captain Wilson
        addressed the assembled Company. At the conclusion of his remarks, he uttered
        the words all replacements resent-- “As for you <i>new men ….”</i> Thereafter all the other officers and
        NCOs, picked up on this phrase,
        repeatedly using these thoughtless words, with the implication that we were
        not up to their measure. The <i>new men</i> tired of hearing about the
        Company’s experiences back in the States at Camp Polk, the California Desert Training Center and the
        Indiantown Gap staging center. This open distinction contributed
        nothing to a cohesiveness of the units within the Company. If anything, it
        created undue friction between the old men and the <i>new men </i>causing
        resentment by both parties. It lingered long after. For whatever reason, the
        Wire Section under Technical Sergeant John R. Myers put aside their
        differences quicker than the other sections. I believe it was because the men
        in the Wire Section, out in the field, were the” blue-collar workers” with
        far more testosterone than the radio operators, message center clerks and
        radio repair technicians. Small
        wire crews assigned to combat units must work as a team. If you are not compatible, you’re quickly replaced.
        When the Company
        went into combat, it was the <i>new men</i> who stood tall and earned Silver
        and Bronze Stars and the Purple Hearts. Death held no distinction for some of
        the <i>new men </i>replacements; it resulted in their bodies being sent home
        for burial.
    </p>
    <p>
        Captain
        Wilson may have commanded the Signal Company, but the Company was actually run
        by First Sergeant Leonard Mainiero - no one questioned his authority and all
        respected him. He was tough as nails and nasty as barbed wire when need be,
        but always fair and firm with his troops. His rules were simple - keep your
        nose clean, do your job and stay out of trouble. Cross the line and you had to
        deal with him - one on one.
    </p>
    <p>Christmas 1943 was not a very cheerful time
        as it was our first Christmas with more to come overseas. It also brought more
        new arrivals. These <i>new men </i>held rank - some were Staff Sergeants and
        others were three stripers. Now these men really drew the wrath of resentment
        from the Company old timers who felt it added insult to injury to bring in <i>new
            men</i> who out ranked them! They had nothing to fear from us Privates. As
        dreary and lonely as it was, it was nothing to compare with the Christmas next
        year in the Ardennes Forest of the Eiffel Mountains of Belgium.
    </p>
    <p>
        Early in
        February 1944, Sergeant Mainiero sent for me and I could not imagine why,
        having toed the line, followed orders and having been an exemplary soldier. I
        reported to the Orderly Room on the double. It was the first time that he had
        personally spoken to me since my arrival in the Company. As all First Soldiers
        converse at times like these, he began by telling me that he had “good news and bad news.” Dispensing
        with the bad news first, he said he had received,
        through channels, my acceptance for aviation cadet training which I had tested
        and applied for in the States the previous summer. He told me that regulations
        prohibit sending applicants back to the USA for pilot training and offered to punch my TS (Tough Shit)
        ticket as a
        condolence in mock sympathy. Any dreams and aspirations that I once had when I
        enlisted in the Army as a volunteer for the Air Corps went down the drain.
        That confirmed that I would remain a ground-pounder for the duration.
    </p>
    <p>
        That
        communication out of the way, he told me the good news. It was that in
        reviewing my records the Company Clerk, doing his diligent work, discovered
        that I had not received the mandatory “shipping out” seven-day furlough
        home; as most men did under Army policy before shipping overseas. Sergeant
        Mainiero asked if I wanted to take seven days to visit London and I answered, “Affirmative!” What a
        question! Seven days of freedom
        alone to do as I pleased? In London of all places - unbelievable. Tell me I’m not dreaming. The clerk
        started
        making out the orders as I went back to the barracks to start packing.
    </p>
    The barracks - they were not exactly as one might imagine. I’ll try to
    describe the quarters like this. The property had belonged to a British farmer
    prior to the war that grew mushrooms in his sixteen <i>windowless </i>long<i> </i>wooden
    sheds that were roofed with sheets of corrugated steel. Unfinished common
    rough wooden plank walls connected the sheds. On each wall there was a
    waist-high wooden plank shelf 40 inches wide that ran the full length of the
    structure. The shelves were designed to hold trays of mushrooms grown from
    seed in the semi-darkness. Each shed had a door at each end and contained
    three light bulbs equally spaced dangling on a wire. The shed contained two
    full length common walls, connected to similar sheds on each side. We had two
    divided rows of eight connected sheds. The space of each shed provided
    sleeping “quarters” for 20 men (10 men per side) sleeping head to foot.
    The floors were rough concrete. This was bare bones no frills accommodations.
    If you had enough rank, it wasn’t all that bad. The top NCOs slept in the
    few small former tool-sheds that had privacy, windows and cots.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we
        arrived at the “Mushroom Farm” we were issued a British army cotton body
        bag and told to fill it with straw from a field adjoining the property to
        serve as our “organic” mattress. The straw compressed very quickly
        requiring a second filling. Bedding consisted of two army blankets - nothing
        else. Many of us donned wool knit caps to sleep at night as well as using our
        overcoats on top of the blankets to render additional warmth. None of the buildings were heated. Nor was the
        single shower room,
        located in a small building nearby. The latrine was a conversation piece all
        by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        latrine, for enlisted men, was 100 yards away from the barn like structures
        called barracks. The toilet consisted of a single giant outhouse. Our pissoire
        was a12 foot metal trough lining the single wall; adjacent to our community
        toilet seats comprised of 20 holes in one row made of the same unfinished <i>rough</i>
        wooden planks covering galvanized buckets located underneath - termed
        “honey buckets.”-- they were anything but. The back and roof of the open
        structure was covered with corrugated sheet metal, but the front was open
        facing an empty field. British civilians collected the buckets once a week to
        use as “night soil” on their farms as fertilizer. Once I discovered that
        and I never again ate their Brussels sprouts! Rather than make the long walk
        in the pitch darkness to the latrine some distance away, in the dead of night,
        many of us would walk out the door of our shed and urinate against the top
        NCOs sleeping quarters - providing relief and at the same time providing
        self-serving revenge. They knew the next morning they had visitors from the
        telltale odor of piss and although they threatened, they never caught any of
        us in the act.
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        nearby Mess Hall was also constructed with the sheet steel with a bare
        concrete floor. It contained several dozen wooden picnic-type tables holding
        six men each. Prior to our arrival it was already considered inadequate to
        service the Company seating requirements. With our arrival, we compounded the
        situation even more. It was common to stand out in the rain waiting for a seat
        to open, so the early birds were the wisest - or else wait until the rush
        was over. Timing was very important for the <i>new men </i>to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        officers commandeered the single brick farmhouse on the property - reminding
        us that “rank hath its privilege,” which we knew all too well. They
        enjoyed the comfort of sharing two to a single room, private toilet and dining
        with their own cooks and table waiters. Despite the majority of the officers
        being married, the officers’ quarters often entertained overnight female
        guests when they held weekend parties, much to our envy and did not go
        unnoticed. It was the old story - “Don’t do as I do, do as I say.”
        Signal Company jeep drivers served as chauffeurs for the officers’ dates.
        Those of us who pulled Guard Duty on the Main Gate on those weekend nights
        would make note of the time the guests would leave the next morning, at
        daylight, often driven home in a jeep by an officer. Yes, indeed, rank does
        have privileges!
    </p>
    <p>
        February
        7, 1944 arrived and I left for seven days in London. I caught a ride to the train station and took off for
        civilization, planning
        to see as much as I could in that short period. This was a chance of a
        lifetime few soldiers ever receive. I intended to make the most of it and I
        did. The Red Cross Club for enlisted men in London was located in the West End District near Marble Arch
        across the street from Hyde Park. It was easy walking distance of the famous tourist spots I intended to
        visit. Every day I spent taking in the different sights of London - Big Ben,
        Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey, St. Paul’s Cathedral, Windsor
        Castle, Trafalgar Square, Number 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace,
        Cleopatra’s Needle, The Horse Guards at Whitehall, St. James Park, Petticoat
        Lane on Middlesex Street, Grosvenor Square (SHAEF HQS), London Bridge, Tower
        Bridge, Waterloo Bridge, The Tower of London with the Beef Eaters Guards,
        Piccadilly Circus, Covent Gardens Ballroom and Soho. This was the opportunity
        that comes along but once in a lifetime and I didn’t want to overlook the
        many historic places. The Red Cross offered tours to visit interesting places
        including Stratford on the Avon, the home of The Bard, William Shakespeare that was a must on my list.
        Getting around on public transportation -- bus, subway and rail system was
        easy and very economical.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each
        night shortly after sun down, thousands of Londoners would bed down deep in
        the lower sections of the subways for fear of the German bombers nightly runs
        overhead. At the sound of sirens and warnings of approaching planes, the
        patrons in bars would head for the nearest bomb shelter or subway. Instead of
        running for cover, foolishly one night I went across the street to Hyde Park and watched the anti-aircraft
        batteries open up with searchlights and gunfire.
        The search light crews would criss-cross the skies until they locked in on the
        silver speck making his bomb run overhead. The rapid fire from the guns would
        send spent shell fragments falling to the cobblestone streets like falling
        light rain.
    </p>
    <p>
        All too
        soon my freedom to roam came to an end and I had to return to the dismal
        mushroom farm and military life. I was not eager to do either after seven days
        in London, but all good things must come to an end eventually. Upon return my friends
        queried me on my sojourn and listened with envy as I described the great
        melting pot of Europe and the historic places I had seen. There were those who thought I had wasted
        my time, when their interests were in other areas - booze and women. I
        explained that there were plenty of both as soon as darkness fell. The
        streetwalkers came out in droves. Any GI was fair game and openly approached
        by the ladies of the night. They consummated their contractual agreement in
        any available doorway or on the grass of the Hyde Park grounds. The old joke was don’t step on those sand
        bags, they groan. Also
        out in droves were the MPs wearing the conspicuous white painted helmet liners
        looking for the rowdies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back to
        the routine of the Signal Company and the restricted life style once again
        found me back at my old habits. Immediately after the evening meal I would
        head for the single building with electric lights we used as a day room. It
        had tables where I could write home with my daily letters to family and “the
        girl back home”. Although I knew the letters were read and censored by our
        Company officers, it didn’t stop me from criticizing some of them; in
        particular, Captain Wilson for some of his chicken-shit policies and bible
        thumping righteousness. During an inspection of our barracks, he gave me a
        tongue-lashing lecture for having a pinup photo on the wall of a nude female.
        I never wrote anything compromising military security, so in reality they had
        nothing to censor or remove from my letters. But I had hit a nerve -- personal
        criticism! Captain Wilson soon sent for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was mid-May 1944; I stood at attention in
        his office as he read me the riot act. It was for my remarks that I had
        written about suspected marital indiscretions by his fellow officers and
        himself with their overnight female guests. The man was livid with rage.
        Spittle spewed from his mouth as he ranted at me. Finally, he demanded to know
        if I wanted out of his Company and I immediately answered “Yes, sir!” His
        smug look of contempt on his face told me he had already made a predetermined
        solution; then he said, “Marsh, you are going to the 36<sup>th</sup> Armored
        Infantry Regiment as soon as I can arrange your transfer. Get out of my
        office.” The son of a bitch had mousetrapped me! I had walked -no, jumped
        with both feet into that box. In a few days I learned that I would be assigned
        to the 3<sup>rd</sup> Battalion Headquarters of the 36<sup>th</sup> Infantry
        with Corporal Francisco Bola from Peabody, Massachusetts as a two man jeep wire team.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the
        same time, the Second Armored Division had been selected as the first armored
        division to land with the Invasion Forces of France next month in June. With
        the expected casualties estimated at a minimum of 10%, which meant the Second
        Armored would need 1,450 immediate replacements to cover their losses. The 143<sup>rd</sup>
        Signal, now almost battalion size in strength, was near double the number 256
        authorized in the Table of Organization, so they were hit with the levy. I
        believe my name was at the top of the list personally hand picked by Captain
        Wilson. The fortunes of war were smiling down at me as I barely escaped Wilson’s intended punishment, a
        possible death sentence with the Infantry.
    </p>
    <p>
        May 27,
        1944 arrived and none too soon; my PCS (Permanent Change of Station) was
        happening. The orders for those of us departing were posted on the Bulletin
        Board outside the Orderly Room as a formality. All of us had been notified, in
        person, that we were leaving the 143<sup>rd</sup> and going to the “Hell On
        Wheels” Second Armored Division’s 142<sup>nd</sup> Armored Signal Company
        - joining the veterans of the North Africa and Sicily Campaigns.
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        early morning rain had stopped and the welcome warm sunshine appeared as our
        small group of selected transfer designates began to assemble in front of the
        Orderly Room for our last roll call there. First Soldier Mainiero appeared
        carrying his ever present clipboard and proceeded to call our names one by
        one. A Corporal in charge of the truck transportation was given a large sealed
        envelope containing our 201 Service Records, as the First Soldier, keeping
        with his expected demeanor, turned and walked away without saying a word to
        any of us. Business as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
        Several
        of our close friends were standing by to shake hands and say goodbye. Among
        them were Harry Tuttle, Ken Speers, Ed Robitaille, Sergeant Murdo McLeod, Norm
        Steele and my old nemesis …Sergeant Herman Moeller. In his never to be
        forgotten Brooklynese-German accent, he couldn’t refrain from giving me his
        parting friendly needle, as he sarcastically said, “Well, there goes our
        soldier boy who likes to write letters home about officers. We’re going to
        miss you, Marsh.” I replied, “Sure you will. I can see you’re broken
        hearted. You had better watch your ass as you are next to go.” With that, I
        gave him the one finger salute, which he quickly returned to me with a laugh,
        saying, “Good luck, I’ll see ya.” Little did either of us dream that we
        would meet a year later in Berlin in the Tiergarten.
    </p>

    <p>Among the two truckloads of men transferring, accompanying me were
        wiremen Lawrence A. Hull (a <i>new man)</i>, Clovis Waldroop and Glenn E.
        Springer, both old cadre men in the 143<sup>rd.</sup> One chapter of my
        military life was closing and another about to open. Destiny was now set in
        motion - in less than two weeks I would be landing in France.
