“war to end all wars” was over, the welcome home parades and merriment of
the returning servicemen had long come to close; finally it was time to get back
to “normalcy.” A whole new era was commencing. The country had returned to
civilian employment and thousands of ex-service persons sought education in the
higher institutions under the GI Bill of Rights. Lacking further personal
interest in academic achievements, I declined the use of this gratuitous
extraordinary veteran’s benefit and my pursuits soon turned to other
interests.</font></p>

new session of my life was about to begin; but soon after reporting for duty at
Fort Sheridan, Illinois, in reality it almost seemed as though I had never left
the Army. The post war Regular Army had now been drastically reduced in numbers
evolved from the millions of men called to duty via the Selective Service call
up. The draftees had all been discharged and those who remained in uniform were
now all volunteers. It was a radical experience to compare the two time periods.
All military branches were ordered to become integrated. Gone were the 90 day
wonders and misfit officers. This “new army” would thankfully never take on
the appearance of the pre-WWII “old army”; also the hectic days of WWII were
also a part of history. However, this new peacetime Army was very much the same
as the old Army SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) that I knew during the war,
in one respect – “hurry up and wait.” The more things are said to change,
the more they appear to be the same. Only the pace, at times, was much slower
and unhurried. These people were marking time – until the next call to arms;
it would come sooner than anyone expected, June 25, 1950 on the Pusan Peninsula
of South Korea.</font></p>

in was a repeat performance of filling out forms and drawing all new uniforms
once again. No more living in the temporary war time wooden barracks, but
assignment to the permanent Parade Ground brick buildings built at the turn of
the century for the Artillery Brigade. These were the very same buildings in
which my father was quartered in during World War One, only now upgraded with
modern conveniences. In the beginning, while the Escort Company Table of
Organization was being nationally recruited many vacancies remained unfilled. As
the nucleus of the first troops with the Cadre, we were only required to report
for morning roll call and then the remainder of the day was spent on sports
activities and personal free time.</font></p>

. In time the Company rapidly filled the T/O vacancies with Regular Army
decorated combat vets. Prior service in a combat unit was a basic requirement
needed to apply. The T/O was not bound by rank restriction, only numbers. At one
period we had thirty-seven (37) NCOs wearing First Sergeants chevrons on the
double over-sized company roster; with numerous Masters, Sergeants First Class
in addition to Staffs and Bucks. Many had formerly served as Company Grade
officers during the war and accepted grade reduction to Master, Sergeant First
Class or Staff Sergeant to enlist upon reentry. Former commissioned fighter
pilots returned as Staff Sergeants.</font></p>

Commander, Colonel John L. Turner, Artillery, who had risen from the ranks after
enlisting as a Private in World War One, conducted the final interview of
applicants, which required his personal approval for acceptance. I’ll never
forget his final question after inquiring what combat unit I had served in
during the war. I was standing at attention in front of his desk when he asked,
“Soldier, can you go three or four days without taking a drink (meaning hard
liquor)?” In a firm voice, I answered, “Yes, Sir!” Drinking, while on
assignment escorting the remains, was a Cardinal sin and would be dealt with
severe disciplinary action we were told.</font></p>

Army school with daily training sessions at the American Graves Registration
Service, Distribution Center No. 8 , Chicago Quartermaster Depot at 1749 West
Pershing Road, Chicago, Illinois. Classes were conducted in all phases ranging
from examining the casket for odors emanating from the hermetically sealed
bronze casket, folding the flag into a triangle with only the stars on the blue
background visible, maintaining constant exemplary personal conduct, meeting
with the grieving family, obtaining a signature of release on the government
forms and documents, performing functions at the military funerals and what to
expect in train travel. Although the casket was shipped in the baggage car in a
flag draped shipping case; we were issued tickets for either a sleeping car or
coach, depending on the distance traveled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was drilled into us that it was our responsibility to arrive at the
destination <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">together</i>. That meant
close coordination with the conductor on every train to prevent being separated

the time of day or night. Lose that casket and you were gone!</font></p>

funeral were to be conducted. After the firing squads had fired their volleys,
the bugler would blow Taps; then with the assistance of one pallbearer I would
fold the flag in the blue triangle with only the white stars visible and present
it to the next of kin. The family – grief stricken, sat there sobbing and numb
as I placed the flag in the outstretched hands of the recipient. I had to steel
myself so as not to lose my composure. I always made eye contact as I said to
them by rote, “I present this flag as a token of appreciation from a grateful
nation.” Adding my personal regrets, I would render a sharp hand salute, do an
about face and exit to find the hearse for a ride back to the city – and
another assignment. Often new escorts made only the initial trip and asked to be
relieved, unable to handle the emotional and psychological stress of their first
experience.</font></p>

  village. The young soldier had married just before shipping overseas and left
  a young widow and a grieving family. The funeral director met me at the rail

  shipping case was taken to the funeral home where a service was held the next
  day as they had been sent advance notice of our arrival date and time. The

  “I present this flag as an appreciation from a grateful nation.” Then

  </span>Technically, my job was done, except to secure a ride back to the
  funeral home. The widow had asked that I ride in her car behind the hearse
  going to the cemetery, so I had planned on riding back with the hearse driver,
  only to learn that he was the first to drive off without waiting for me. When
  the small crowd had finished offering their condolences to her, she saw me
  standing there and beckoned for me to join her in the car provided by the
  funeral home. She reached out to take my arm with the flag under her other
  arm. Reaching the car, I opened the rear door for her and she slid in and
  mentioned for me to sit next to her, which I accepted. She nonchalantly tossed
  the flag in the other corner and set back as she started a conversation with a
  smile by asking, “Do you have a girl friend and where are you from?” To
  say I was surprised was putting it mildly.</font></p>

  formal complaint from a widow on my very first assignment! The perils of being
  in the cross hairs of a young widow! This was a wake up call for future trips
  to come. The eye-opening lesson learned was that not all widows were
  distraught over the death of her soldier husband; perhaps the marriage was the
  result of a brief war time romance where love also became a casualty in the

  said, “Let’s open up da fucking box and see what’s in dere.” Part of

  of the three soldiers chose Grand Rapids, Michigan as a central part of the
  country as their final resting place with a grave marker bearing all three
  names. Fitting they served together, crashed and died together and were buried
  together for eternity.</font></p>

  thing that sticks in my mind was the way in which the patriotism waned in the
  three short years. In 1947 when the program first started everybody
  volunteered to assist with the burial details. The city mayors would show up
  with other dignitaries to have their photos taken for the newspapers. The
  seven man firing squads always had back-ups available on short notice. Buglers
  were easy to find. But in, 1949, the third and final year it was difficult to
  round up enough men, to the point where I would go to the VFW and American
  Legion club houses to ask for support.</font></p>

  the three years of this honored and solemn duty, many men served in our Escort
  Company. Some stayed and many moved on after but a few trips. Our over-sized
  Company swelled to 603 assigned on 31 January 1949 at the peak of the program.
