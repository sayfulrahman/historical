    <h1 class="center">THE REPLACEMENT</h1>
    <p class="center"><b><i>By Don R. Marsh</i></b></p>
    <p>12 April 1945 Unna, Germany</p>
    <p>No one recalls exactly when the 21-year-old Private joined
        the Company. The truth of the matter is that &quot;A&quot; Company roster no
        longer contained the names of many of the men on the original roster after it
        first went into combat. Casualties in all ranks had taken its toll and the turn
        over in personnel left too few of the once familiar faces and names. By the end
        of the war, Captain Robert D. Mizner had become the sixth Company Commander,
        replacing the five others who came before him. No one, regardless of rank, was
        spared from the danger in an Infantry line company. Company A, 7th Infantry
        Battalion, Combat Command &quot;A&quot;, 8th Armored Division was among those
        with the highest figures, so it is no wonder few would remember the Private's
        face or name in the unit. His Platoon Sergeant John R. Hartwell, 3rd Platoon,
        spent most of his time assigning new men to squads after the Company suffered
        70% losses in its first week in combat; commencing January 21, 1945 at Nennig,
        Germany, with Patton's Third Army. Frost bitten feet accounted for a heavy
        percentage of men lost in the minus 10 degree winter. Following that initial
        blood bath, the replacements came and went with regularity, making it difficult
        to put a face with a name of a rifleman on the Morning Report. How long one
        lasted &quot;on the line&quot; was one of the mysteries of war and circumstances
        - spelled luck. The majority of current names remaining on the Morning Report,
        in all likelihood, had been replacements themselves.
    </p>
    <p>You won't last very long in a line outfit if you are
        either an extrovert or an introvert; to survive, you soon learn to go with the
        flow. As they say, misery loves company, so look for another &quot;new man&quot;
        to buddy-up with - he's the guy in a telltale new uniform, like yours. Don't
        take it personal that the &quot;old men&quot; don't associate with the &quot;new
        men&quot; at first; as time goes by, through sheer numbers and attrition, you'll
        be one of them, if you're among the lucky ones. It is not easy for a newcomer to
        make friends. You speak when spoken to, listen, watch and learn, but don't voice
        your opinion unless asked.

        His arrival in the Company was just in time for the Rhine
        Offensive in the spring of 1945, close to the war's end. Having been funneled
        through the various induction facilities, first completing Basic Training and
        then the advanced Infantry course, he rapidly moved through the transfer
        procedures to various overseas pipeline replacement depots. At the end of the
        line, he was finally assigned to &quot;A&quot; Company in Combat Command
        &quot;A.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        After experiencing months of loneliness of being just
        another number in the replacement pool of total strangers, he welcomed the
        knowledge that this would be his last transfer. To paraphrase an Army expression
        - he had found a home! He quietly blended right in with the others in his half-
        track and responded to orders by rote. The time had come for him to join the
        Brotherhood of War here at his final destination.
    </p>
    <p>
        In keeping with his Christian teachings, he agonized over
        his pending metamorphosis of experiencing the dread of killing another human
        being; however, he would not have long to wait to face that decision of
        conscience. Destiny had brought him to this climatic point in his young
        adulthood.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many of the specific details are still lacking about those
        difficult days of April 1945 with the war in its final stages of fighting. The
        fronts were fluid and changing daily with the rapid advances and constant danger
        from bypassed pockets of desperate German troops unwilling to surrender,
        preferring to fight in a losing cause, regardless of the cost. Roads and
        villages in the rear at any given hour once thought to be secure turned into
        deadly ambushes for unsuspecting Americans, as it happened to Norm Steele and
        other Signal Wire men in jeeps. Strong German forces were determined to fight
        their way out of the ring of steel.
    </p>
    <p>
        This was to be the final offensive in an all out attempt
        to crush the last resistance as we made our way towards the biggest prize of all
        the Allies - Berlin. In the wake of a giant pincer movement of the two American
        Armies, the First and the Ninth, numerous heavily fortified and well defended
        pockets of resistance were deliberately bypassed for expediency and were
        designated to be eliminated in mop-up operations. The brilliant encirclement
        closing the trap at Lippstadt by the US 2nd Armored &quot;Hell On
        Wheels&quot;(my unit) and 3rd Armored &quot;Spearhead&quot; Divisions sealed the
        fate of 350,000 German troops captured there on April 1st. This was initially
        called the Paderborn Pocket; later renamed the Rose Pocket in honor of the
        slain, Major General Maurice Rose, Commanding General of the 3rd Armored
        Division, Killed In Action, on 30 March 1945 at Hamborn, Germany. Rose was in a
        column with the leading Task Force (Welborn) in the attempt to capture Paderborn;
        closing the door and shortening the war by months, without the additional loss
        of life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Company &quot;A&quot; was assigned as a part of this huge
        mop-up operation. The initial objective being the city of Unna, located just
        west of the Teutoburger Wald (forest) in the triangle formed by the cities of
        Lippstadt, Hamm and Dortmund. Unna was primarily defended by the remnants of the
        once proud German 116th (Greyhounds) Panzer Division. Included in their strength
        were 4 Jagdtigers from the Schwere Panzerjagerabteilung 512th (Heavy Tank
        Destroyer Battalion) and 17 Mark IV Panzers from the 16th Panzer Regiment. Most
        were attached to the 156th Panzer grenadier Regiment and the remainder to the
        60th Regiment, reinforced on the night of April 10th by alarm units. Supported
        by the SS Signal Ersatz Battalion; the 1st &amp; 2nd Battalion 401st Volks
        Artillery Corps; and numerous Landschutzen and flak units; reinforced by Hitler
        Jugend from the Mulhausen garrison. The German 190 Infantry Division was also in
        the area, with the total amounting to a formidable force of strength.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 8th Armored Division CO, Major General John M. Devine,
        ordered BG Charles F. Colson's CCA to attack Unna early on the morning of the
        11th. The attack on Unna began at 0630 hours, April 11th against well dug in
        defenders, without the element of surprise as the attack was expected. Just
        prior to jumping off, the new replacements had been thoroughly briefed by the
        platoon leaders and non-coms what to expect in assignments, as they assembled in
        the early morning hours of darkness. The kid from Wisconsin, now a
        &quot;seasoned veteran&quot; of less than one month, nervously checked his M1
        Garand rifle, secured his grenades, having drawn sufficient ammo clips for his
        bandoleer. He moved out with the rest of his squad. His fateful date with
        Destiny had now placed him at the wrong place and wrong time - the clock was
        ticking down.
    </p>
    <p>
        April became a meat-grinder for all American armored
        divisions in the First, Third and Ninth Armies, under Generals Hodges, Patton
        and Simpson as they urged their Corp Commanders to hammer the Germans. Slowly
        the defenses crumbled under the combined onslaught with the added weight of
        British and Canadian forces driving in the north. The race for Berlin, a mere 56
        miles away, was on in full force.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following a 15 minute preparation on Unna by five
        Artillery Battalions, CCA, under BG Charles F. Colson, jumped off at 0630 hours
        with Task Force Goodrich, led by Lt. Col. G.B. Goodrich, CO, 18th Tank
        Battalion, moving up from the south and Task Force Poinier, led by Lt. Col.
        Arthur Poinier, CO, 7th Armored Infantry Battalion, moving in from the
        southeast. The main approach to Unna from the east (the Unna-Soest Road)
        traversed across almost level ground. To the south the terrain sloped upward to
        form a ridge, the crest of which was approximately two kilometers from the
        roadway. This ridge dominated the road and had to be taken before any armored
        unit could move safely towards Unna. Moving on Unna from the south, Company A,
        of Task Force Goodrich was pinned down by fire coming from some barracks and a
        wooded area. Task Force Goodrich continued the attack with excellent
        tank-infantry teamwork, entering the town from the south and moving through, to
        clean out resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bitter fighting raged from house to house as the
        German defenders fought with fury. The Army Air Corps P47s and P51s attacked the
        German armor destroying 11 tanks from the air. In the action, in addition to the
        tanks lost, the Germans also lost five dual-purpose 40 mm guns, a battery of 88s
        and 160 POWs captured in town. The ground fighting was intense as the attackers
        inflicted heavy casualties on the defenders who would make &quot;A&quot; Company
        pay a stiff price of five Company men Killed In Action. Others were wounded in
        capturing the objective, the city of Unna when it fell at 1400 hours. Fighting
        continued to rage with the German withdrawal from the inner city to nearby
        wooded areas. The war at this point was far from over. Many more would die on
        both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the five Company men lost was PFC Gilbert Forest
        Lindgren, ASN 36 845571, my nephew, my sister's only child, born 21 November
        1923, inducted 23 August 1944 at Racine, Wisconsin. Ironically, &quot;A&quot;
        Company went into Division Reserve the following day outside of Wolfenbuttel and
        never returned to combat again.
    </p>
    <p>
        On May 5, 1945,&quot;A&quot; Company Commander. Robert D.
        Mizner, sat down to write his obligatory letters of condolence to the parents of
        his men recently lost in the last battle, including the letter to Gilbert's
        mother in which he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
        The officers and men of the Company join me in their
        heartfelt condolence to you upon the death of your son who was killed in action
        in Germany on 12 April 1945. He was buried with full military honors in a United
        States Military Cemetery in Margraten, Holland, with appropriate religious
        services held by a Chaplain. The division had been fighting in a southwesterly
        direction back into the 'Ruhr Pocket' created by the junction of the Second and
        Third Armored Divisions. Gilbert was a member of a rifle squad in the attack on
        the city of Unna, Germany. He was a rifleman in action - when he was hit and
        killed by enemy fire from a machine gun nest. Your son was a 'new-comer' to our
        battalion, but was with us long enough to become liked by all officers and men,
        and to be recognized for his outstanding courage and devotion to duty. Every man
        misses your son and shares your grief.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        May 7th brought V-E Day and the war in Europe was
        officially ended. The men now were resigned to wait for transportation to return
        them home to the United States. The return of the dead would have to wait until
        1947 for repatriation and reburial in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, fifty-seven years after the fact, Gilbert's name
        appears on a government grave stone marker, just one more faceless ghost of the
        past. In reflection, he never felt the joy of returning home to his loved ones,
        finding his girl who promised to wait for him, attending the University of
        Wisconsin with the GI Bill, receiving a degree in journalism and later one day
        becoming a writer, military historian, author and becoming a husband, father and
        grandfather - all the things we mortals take for granted in life, this is what
        he sacrificed.
