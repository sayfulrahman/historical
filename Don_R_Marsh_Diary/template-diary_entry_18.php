    <h1><strong>CROSSING THE RUBICON</strong></h1>
    <p><i><strong>By Don R. Marsh</strong></i></p>
    <p>
        The “war to end all wars” was over, the welcome home parades and merriment of
        the returning servicemen had long come to close; finally it was time to get back
        to “normalcy.” A whole new era was commencing. The country had returned to
        civilian employment and thousands of ex-service persons sought education in the
        higher institutions under the GI Bill of Rights. Lacking further personal
        interest in academic achievements, I declined the use of this gratuitous
        extraordinary veteran’s benefit and my pursuits soon turned to other
        interests.
    </p>
    <p>The weeks passed by rapidly and soon turned to months. I knew that I was drifting
        aimlessly without a goal or motivation. Something was missing. For some, myself
        included, the return to civilian life had become very dull and boring. After
        having seen New York City, London, Paris, Berlin and other European places that I had only read about, Racine
        was a dismal place to think of spending the remainder of my life working in
        industry with a two week vacation every year. I yearned to see the Pacific
        Ocean, Hawaii, Los Angeles, San Francisco, the Rocky Mountains, the Great Northwest and other parts of the
        world. The wanderlust in me wanted
        to escape, but I needed to find the resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        My
        meeting with the local Army Recruiting Sergeant at our VFW Club was more than
        just circumstance - it had to be fate. This was to be my means to depart from
        this rust belt industrial small hick town. The nomadic military life and
        camaraderie once again beckoned. I heard the “Lorelei’s call” and I made
        what many thought was a questionable decision to re-enlist in the Army to become
        a Military Escort on special assignment.
    </p>
    <p>The
        Sarge had informed me of a new Army program about to be set into motion. The 80<sup>th</sup>
        congress in May 1946 and passed into Public Law No. 599 in a repatriation
        program for soldiers who had been temporarily buried overseas during the war. The
        families and next of kin were given these options:
    </p>
    <p>1. Internment of the remains in a permanent American Military Cemetery overseas.</p>
    <p>2. Returning the remains to the United States for internment in a private cemetery.</p>
    <p>3. Return of the remains to the United States for interment in a National Cemetery.</p>
    <p>4. Interment of the remains in a private cemetery overseas.</p>
    <p>
        Among the notables buried in overseas cemeteries are: General Patton is buried in Luxembourg among his troops.
        General Maurice Rose is buried in Margraten, The Netherlands.
        Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Mart Bailey, Jr. is buried at St. Laurent, Omaha Beach, Normandy, France. Today the
        Military Cemeteries overseas hold thousands of the fallen soldiers
        lost in WWII in which the families declined to have their remains returned home:
        Brittany, France 4,410; Cambridge, England 3,812; St. Laurent-sur-Mer, Omaha
        Beach, Normandy, France 9,386; Netherlands 8,302; Henri-Chapelle, France 7,989;
        Ardennes, Belgium 5,328; Luxembourg 5,076; Lorraine, Moselle, France 10,489;
        Epinal, Vosges, France 5,255; Sicily-Rome, Nettuno, Italy 7,862; North Africa,
        Carthage, Tunisia 2,841; Rhone, Var, France 861; Florence, Italy 4,402 and in
        the Pacific the Manila Cemetery 17,206. In addition to the World War One
        cemeteries in Belgium and France.
    </p>
    <p class="center"><b><i>Once you cross the Rubicon, there is no return.</i></b></p>

    <p>A
        new session of my life was about to begin; but soon after reporting for duty at
        Fort Sheridan, Illinois, in reality it almost seemed as though I had never left
        the Army. The post war Regular Army had now been drastically reduced in numbers
        evolved from the millions of men called to duty via the Selective Service call
        up. The draftees had all been discharged and those who remained in uniform were
        now all volunteers. It was a radical experience to compare the two time periods.
        All military branches were ordered to become integrated. Gone were the 90 day
        wonders and misfit officers. This “new army” would thankfully never take on
        the appearance of the pre-WWII “old army”; also the hectic days of WWII were
        also a part of history. However, this new peacetime Army was very much the same
        as the old Army SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) that I knew during the war,
        in one respect - “hurry up and wait.” The more things are said to change,
        the more they appear to be the same. Only the pace, at times, was much slower
        and unhurried. These people were marking time - until the next call to arms;
        it would come sooner than anyone expected, June 25, 1950 on the Pusan Peninsula
        of South Korea.
    </p>
    <p>
        Processing
        in was a repeat performance of filling out forms and drawing all new uniforms
        once again. No more living in the temporary war time wooden barracks, but
        assignment to the permanent Parade Ground brick buildings built at the turn of
        the century for the Artillery Brigade. These were the very same buildings in
        which my father was quartered in during World War One, only now upgraded with
        modern conveniences. In the beginning, while the Escort Company Table of
        Organization was being nationally recruited many vacancies remained unfilled. As
        the nucleus of the first troops with the Cadre, we were only required to report
        for morning roll call and then the remainder of the day was spent on sports
        activities and personal free time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The
        word had been sent out to all commands across the USA for qualified applicants to apply for this selective and
        honored duty, the need
        of military escorts to return the bodies of the fallen soldiers from their
        overseas temporary burial military cemeteries to their home of record or a National Cemetery. In time the
        Company rapidly filled the T/O vacancies with Regular Army
        decorated combat vets. Prior service in a combat unit was a basic requirement
        needed to apply. The T/O was not bound by rank restriction, only numbers. At one
        period we had thirty-seven (37) NCOs wearing First Sergeants chevrons on the
        double over-sized company roster; with numerous Masters, Sergeants First Class
        in addition to Staffs and Bucks. Many had formerly served as Company Grade
        officers during the war and accepted grade reduction to Master, Sergeant First
        Class or Staff Sergeant to enlist upon reentry. Former commissioned fighter
        pilots returned as Staff Sergeants.
    </p>
    <p>
        My
        section of the barracks was the domain of First Sergeant Lyle W. Stevens, a
        grizzled Old Soldier in the Old Army who was captured on Corregidor; where he was awarded two Silver Stars, a
        Bronze Star and the Purple Heart all
        within two weeks before the island capitulated to the Japanese on May 6, 1942.
        He spent the remainder of the war in a prison of war camp at Hokkaido, Japan. Our Chief of Operations, Master
        Sergeant Forrest H. Kelly, had served in the
        Air Corps with the rank of Lt. Colonel during WWII. With the post war Reduction
        In Force in effect, he accepted the rank of Master Sergeant to complete his 30
        year career, for pension purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another
        decorated combat soldier was Sergeant First Class John R. Rice; “K” Company
        of the 126<sup>th</sup> Infantry Regiment of the famous 32<sup>nd</sup> Infantry
        Division, one of few men entitled to wear 4 stars on the Asiatic Pacific Ribbon.
        He was a Winnebago Indian, assigned to escort the remains of the Native American
        Indian soldiers as needed. The Army’s policy was to assign an Escort by rank,
        race and religion whenever possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our
        Commander, Colonel John L. Turner, Artillery, who had risen from the ranks after
        enlisting as a Private in World War One, conducted the final interview of
        applicants, which required his personal approval for acceptance. I’ll never
        forget his final question after inquiring what combat unit I had served in
        during the war. I was standing at attention in front of his desk when he asked,
        “Soldier, can you go three or four days without taking a drink (meaning hard
        liquor)?” In a firm voice, I answered, “Yes, Sir!” Drinking, while on
        assignment escorting the remains, was a Cardinal sin and would be dealt with
        severe disciplinary action we were told.
    </p>
    <p>
        Having
        met the basic qualifications and after having passed the screening process, I
        was sent to attend a special Fifth
        Army school with daily training sessions at the American Graves Registration
        Service, Distribution Center No. 8 , Chicago Quartermaster Depot at 1749 West
        Pershing Road, Chicago, Illinois. Classes were conducted in all phases ranging
        from examining the casket for odors emanating from the hermetically sealed
        bronze casket, folding the flag into a triangle with only the stars on the blue
        background visible, maintaining constant exemplary personal conduct, meeting
        with the grieving family, obtaining a signature of release on the government
        forms and documents, performing functions at the military funerals and what to
        expect in train travel. Although the casket was shipped in the baggage car in a
        flag draped shipping case; we were issued tickets for either a sleeping car or
        coach, depending on the distance traveled. It was drilled into us that it was our responsibility to arrive at
        the
        destination <i>together</i>. That meant
        close coordination with the conductor on every train to prevent being separated
        from the baggage car. Wherever that baggage car went - you went, regardless of
        the time of day or night. Lose that casket and you were gone!
    </p>
    <p>
        Just
        prior to the end of the classroom work we were offered one last chance to drop
        out of the course, without prejudice, due to the potential psychological effect
        the duty would entail with the highly emotional circumstances of the assignment.
        I successfully passed all school requirements to become a military escort
        assigned to the Fifth Army Headquarters in Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
        Money
        was never a motivational factor to me, so by serving in this capacity I was
        giving back to my friends Bob Rosenberg, Norm Steele and Lowell Dillard who were
        Killed In Action and didn’t return. Some of my assignments were to escort the
        remains of men from my hometown, Racine, Wisconsin and in doing so, I knew members of the soldiers’ families,
        which made the
        duty all the more challenging. I was on the road with another assignment when my
        nephew, PFC Gilbert Lindgren, was returned for burial in Racine, or I would have been assigned that daunting
        task.
    </p>

        <i>When danger is past and all things righted God is forgotten and the Soldier slighted. Anon.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
        At
        every burial ceremony I witnessed the reopening of the emotional heart-wrenching
        pain of the widows, Gold Star Mothers and family members of the men lost. If
        requested by the family, I would attend the burial ceremony if a military
        funeral were to be conducted. After the firing squads had fired their volleys,
        the bugler would blow Taps; then with the assistance of one pallbearer I would
        fold the flag in the blue triangle with only the white stars visible and present
        it to the next of kin. The family - grief stricken, sat there sobbing and numb
        as I placed the flag in the outstretched hands of the recipient. I had to steel
        myself so as not to lose my composure. I always made eye contact as I said to
        them by rote, “I present this flag as a token of appreciation from a grateful
        nation.” Adding my personal regrets, I would render a sharp hand salute, do an
        about face and exit to find the hearse for a ride back to the city - and
        another assignment. Often new escorts made only the initial trip and asked to be
        relieved, unable to handle the emotional and psychological stress of their first
        experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        I
        would have on average one trip a week, depending on the distance involved. Local
        trips in Chicago and suburban areas were made by an Army ambulance to deliver the casket to a
        local funeral home. My assignment trips by rail ranged from winter bitter cold
        of the flatlands of North Dakota and Minnesota to sweltering summer humid heat of south Mississippi and Texas,
        plus all the mid-western states in between. Our per diem was five dollars per
        day for our meals - all three of them! Dining car stewards would cringe when I
        handed them the military meal ticket for a paltry $1.25 per meal, which they
        were obliged by law to accept.
    </p>
    <p>
        During
        the frequent lulls between receiving boat load/rail shipments from the overseas
        military cemeteries to the AGRS Depot, we were given generous time off as
        “verbal passes” for R &amp; R. I was also active on the Post’s seasonal
        basketball and baseball teams in season to stay in shape. Early morning physical
        training workouts running up and down the Lake Michigan shoreline banks gave us vigorous workouts. That was
        until the wife of the Fifth
        Army Commanding General, Lt. General Walton H. Walker complained that we shouted
        cadence too loudly while passing their lake front residence on Post. Apparently,
        the lady was not an early morning riser as we were accustomed to doing. We
        rerouted the lake bank drill to accommodate her wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
        General
        Walker and the ranking Admiral from the Great Lakes Naval Station made an
        inspection of the Graves Registration and Quartermaster Depot facilities and the
        hand picked group of military escorts, including our 5012 ASU Military Escort
        Company, plus a large contingent of Marine Corps senior non-coms and another
        large group of Navy Chief Petty Officers—all former combat veterans. When the
        Admiral and General Walker “trooped the line,” General Walker, having served
        as a former armored force commander of the XX Corps in the 3<sup>rd</sup> Army
        under General Patton, stopped when he noticed my Belgian Fourragere decoration
        and 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division shoulder patch. He asked, “Sergeant, what
        unit were you with in the 2<sup>nd</sup>?” I replied that I served in
        Headquarters Combat Command “A” under Brigadier Generals Rose and Collier.
        He said, “Two good men.” and moved on down the line of inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a few months of this solemn duty under my belt, I wrote to several of my former
        ex-Army buddies from the 2nd Armored Division that I had re-upped, with the
        intention of becoming a “lifer.” They could not believe it! To a man, they
        asked, “What the hell were you thinking?” I could only answer, “To each
        his own.”

        <p><b><i>By Don R. Marsh</i></b></p>
        <p class="center"><b>RENDERING A FINAL SALUTE</b></p>
        <p>Out of respect and due to the sensitivity of this article, the names,
            dates, and hometowns of the soldiers’ remains whom I escorted in the years
            1947, 1948 and 1949 shall remain anonymous. During this lengthy tour of duty,
            I kept a record of each of my assignments with the soldier’s name, rank,
            serial number, unit, date and place of death; in addition to the Graves
            Registration Control number of the soldier’s remains.
        </p>
        <p>During
            my three years as a Military Escort at military funerals, I witnessed every
            conceivable emotion possible, from heart wrenching pathos to disgust with
            human behavior; with<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>majority
            falling somewhere in between. More often as not, many of the families were
            honestly grief stricken when the casket arrived home for burial and did not
            attempt to suppress the emotional drain. Parents hold back the sorrow until
            the sight of their loved one being carried from the hearse to the chapel or
            funeral parlor. Then the full realization hits home again that this <i>is</i>
            their <i>lost </i>loved one in that bronze
            flag covered casket.
        </p>
        <p>
            At
            the grave site, a few weep uncontrollably and grasp the casket to lay their
            head on the blue field of the flag to cling one more time as a final goodbye
            to their lost son, father or brother. Others may be stoic without much, if
            any, show of emotion. How they manage to accomplish that facade always
            mystified me. But there are always exceptions to the rule. The men, whose
            remains that I escorted for their final journey, could not possibly have ever
            imagined the unbecoming personal conduct of their next of kin and relatives in
            their supposed time of sorrow and grief.
        </p>
        <p>
            The
            soldiers’ remains to whom I was assigned to escort home were Killed In
            Action or Died of Wounds or Injuries in places all over the world; ranging
            from Australia, Austria, Bataan, Burma, Brazil, China, England, France,
            Germany, Hawaii, Italy, Leyte, Philippine Islands, New Guinea, North Africa,
            Okinawa, and Sicily.
        </p>
        <p>My trips for their reinterment here in the USA were to Arkansas,
            Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Dakota, Tennessee,
            Texas and Wisconsin. The men ranged from Air Corps flying personnel,
            infantrymen, artillerymen and tankers. Some were airborne troopers and some
            were ordinary GIs. Many were from units who fought alongside my division (2<sup>nd</sup>
            Armored Division) in the invasion of the Normandy Beachhead, at St. Lo, in the
            forests of Belgium, in the Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes and in the cities of Germany in the closing
            days of the war. The largest numbers of remains being returned
            were from the European Theatre. The Air Corps GIs met death over the skies of Austria, Belgium,
            England,France, India, Italy, and Germany. Others died of Wounds in American Army Hospitals. All made the
            supreme
            sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>The program back then received a great deal of publicity as compared to
            today’s (2006) unannounced casket laden C-54 flights into Dover AFB where
            photographers are not permitted to show the multiple rows of flag covered
            caskets arriving without fanfare or mention in the media. Back in 1947 when
            the bodies first returned the nation paid open tribute to the funerals held
            across the country, war had touched all communities including small hamlets.
        </p>
        <p>
            My
            first trip was to a small northern Illinois village. The young soldier had married just before shipping
            overseas and left
            a young widow and a grieving family. The funeral director met me at the rail
            station when our train arrived in town with the casket. The flag draped
            shipping case was taken to the funeral home where a service was held the next
            day as they had been sent advance notice of our arrival date and time. The
            whole village turned out for the graveside service. The local veterans groups
            had provided the seven man firing squad, pall bearers and a bugler as the
            local news photographer snapped pictures.
        </p>
        <p>After the chaplain said his piece, the firing squad shocked those standing near the three volleys from the
            rifles, the
            bugler sounded Taps and I stepped up to fold the flag with the assistance of
            one pall bearer who held the blue star field of the flag. Folded neatly, the
            flag in the blue triangle with just the white stars visible lay flat in my
            white gloved hands as I bent down to hand the flag to the young widow’s
            outstretched hands. I addressed her by name and made eye contact, then said,
            “I present this flag as an appreciation from a grateful nation.” Then
            added, “My personal regrets for your loss.” With that, I stood at attention, rendered her a hand salute, did
            an
            about face and stepped off to the side.
        </p>
        <p>Technically, my job was done, except to secure a ride back to the
            funeral home. The widow had asked that I ride in her car behind the hearse
            going to the cemetery, so I had planned on riding back with the hearse driver,
            only to learn that he was the first to drive off without waiting for me. When
            the small crowd had finished offering their condolences to her, she saw me
            standing there and beckoned for me to join her in the car provided by the
            funeral home. She reached out to take my arm with the flag under her other
            arm. Reaching the car, I opened the rear door for her and she slid in and
            mentioned for me to sit next to her, which I accepted. She nonchalantly tossed
            the flag in the other corner and set back as she started a conversation with a
            smile by asking, “Do you have a girl friend and where are you from?” To
            say I was surprised was putting it mildly.
        </p>
        <p>Was this small talk or was this “lonely widow” hitting on me? I assumed the
            former and played it straight, arriving moments later at the funeral home
            where I exited the car and excused myself to speak with the funeral home
            director standing on the steps to the office. The last thing I needed was a
            formal complaint from a widow on my very first assignment! The perils of being
            in the cross hairs of a young widow! This was a wake up call for future trips
            to come. The eye-opening lesson learned was that not all widows were
            distraught over the death of her soldier husband; perhaps the marriage was the
            result of a brief war time romance where love also became a casualty in the
            passage of time.
        </p>

            Shortly after, the Commanding Officer of Fort Sheridan, Illinois received a letter
            from the village leader complimenting me on my military bearing and conduct as
            a representative of his post and the US Army under solemn conditions. This was
            the first of many such compliments I received after facing unusual
            circumstances and conditions I found in performing my duty.

            The winter months made our experiences far from what one would expect conducting
            travel and funeral dispositions in inclement weather. On my wife’s birthday,
            December 7<sup>th</sup>, I arrived at a rail train-head in North Dakota after dark. Jersey Joe Walcott was
            fighting Joe Louis that night, on TV, only
            I missed it. The only person there to meet me was an old man who was the sole
            caretaker of that train station. The funeral home’s hearse had not arrived
            as yet, so the two of us unloaded the shipping case carrying the casket onto a
            baggage cart. The old man noticed I was shivering asked what was wrong and
            expressed amazement when I told him it was too damn cold. He admonished me by
            saying, “Why, hell soldier, it ain’t even started to get cold around here.
            It is <i>only</i> fourteen (14) below
            zero!” I could hardly wait to leave the frozen north on that trip.

            Two
            weeks later, the week before Christmas, found me in Green Bay, Wisconsin, escorting the remains of a soldier
            from the 83<sup>rd</sup> Infantry
            Division killed in the Battle of the Bulge, a division on our flank at the time. I was staying in the Hotel
            Northland, one of the better hotels in the city and went down to dinner in the
            Dining Room, was seated and started reading the menu. Those were in the days
            of our $5 a day <i>total </i>for all three
            meals. I winced as I looked at the prices facing me. When the waitress came to
            take my order, I must have looked uncomfortable in uniform where the prices
            were too steep for my pay grade, I said, “Just give me a hamburger and
            coffee.” All escorts wear a black arm ban covering the left arm chevrons, so
            one would know I was a stranger in town returning the war dead. It wasn’t
            long before she returned with a huge plate containing the largest T-bone steak
            I’ve ever seen. I told her she made a mistake as that was someone else’s
            order. “No mistake, soldier, one of the Packers football team is here in the
            room and is paying your bill. Enjoy your meal.” I have been a Packers fan
            ever since!
        </p>
        <p>
            Facing
            the family of men from your hometown is daunting. I escorted a former high
            school classmate who was killed at Percy, France during the St. Lo Break Out on 30 July 1944. He was an
            Infantryman in the 29<sup>th</sup>
            Infantry Division who along with our division that broke through the German
            defenses. The losses on both sides were horrific in that battle that lasted
            for days until the Germans were forced to retreat. The family looked at me and
            the thought must surely cross their minds with the humane rationale, “Why
            him and not you?” The uncomfortable self-imposed guilt is crushing. Another,
            was the brother of a close high school classmate, Loggie, I’ll call him. His
            brother was shot down in a bomber crew over the Brenner Pass, Italy weeks before the war in Germany ended.
            Bad enough watching a grown man cry over the loss of a family member,
            but gut wrenching when the man is a close friend. Words simply fail you at a
            time like that, and I was at a total loss of words in an attempt to comfort
            him.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ultimate in sadness is when I escorted a soldier who was the only child of an
            elderly widow, without any other next of kin. This woman was totally alone in
            the world without a living blood relative. Can you imagine the pain and
            despair of her loss? Yet, she showed me compassion as a soldier and tried to
            make my job less difficult as humanly possible. She remarked I was also a
            mother’s son serving his country, as her only son did. Her softness
            contrasted that of the Chicago tough guy I ran into.
        </p>
        <p>I escorted the remains of a young Italian-American soldier to a Chicago West
            Side funeral home in the heart of Little Italy. He was killed in <st1:country-region w:st="on">
                <st1:place w:st="on">
                    Germany</st1:place>
            </st1:country-region>
            in 1945 while serving with the 83<sup>rd</sup> Infantry Division. When the
            Army ambulance drove us to the funeral home, on arrival the director called
            the next of kin. He walked in and I introduced myself as the escort, saying,
            “I am the escort for your brother.” That was as far as I got, as he cut me
            off and said, “Dat ain’t my brother—dat’s a fucking box.” This
            character with the bent nose was a local version of Tony Soprano. Next he
            said, “Let’s open up da fucking box and see what’s in dere.” Part of
            our training was to attempt to discourage the family from opening the
            hermetically sealed casket, for obvious traumatic reasons. Nothing I said
            changed his mind and he adamantly made it clear that it was his decision to do
            as he damned well pleased “wid da fucking box.”” Even the Italian
            funeral director’s words fell on deaf ears.
        </p>
        <p>Tough Tony had heard a rumor that during World War One that the Army faked the
            bodies sent home by substituting filled sand bags for a corpse and he wanted
            to see for himself what the “box” contained. I knew from training what to
            expect, but he didn’t. One thing I did know was that I hoped to hell the
            Army didn’t screw it up or my ass was dead meat! They removed the numerous
            Philip head screws from the lid and found the remains wrapped and strapped
            inside. The tough guy was satisfied and I was on my way with my signed
            documents. Thankfully, I never encountered another person like him in my
            assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every
            escort had unusual experiences that we exchanged during our breaks. Only one
            escort temporarily “lost the body” - a Sergeant First Class from the 82<sup>nd</sup>
            Airborne lost the casket when the baggage cars were switched in St. Louis. They eventually located the
            missing remains and the two arrived late at
            their destination. We never saw the Sergeant again as he was immediately
            transferred out.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stranger things than that occur while escorting the remains. One of my trips had taken
            me to Fort Snelling, Minnesota to a National Cemetery burial that was sparsely attended. As a matter of
            fact, except for myself, the
            Chaplain, the firing squad, the bugler and the widow and her mother-in-law, no
            one else was present. The Fort’s burial detail went through their paces; I
            folded the flag and turned to present it to the widow. Then all hell broke
            loose. The mother-in-law, seeing the widow receive the flag, shouted at her,
            “You whore!” The widow countered with, “You bitch!” and then she
            dropped the flag and they got into a fist fight with pulling each other’s
            hair and cursing. The soldier’s flagless casket remained on the vault
            lowering device over the open grave as everybody started to scatter. I left
            them there battling each other as I headed for the hearse that brought me out
            to the Cemetery. I was the designated escort, not a referee.
        </p>
        <p>
            My
            final escort assignment was a first and last -- a group burial of three
            “unknowns.” Three airmen died in an airplane crash at Barrackpore, India. Aboard were one 2<sup>nd</sup>
            Lieutenant, one Flight Officer and one
            Private First Class. The remains recovered from the wreckage were unidentified
            individually, but were certified as the crew members from flight records. The
            Army Air Corps decided to place a set of remain in a separate casket for each
            member and proposed a group burial to their families. Two officers represented
            the Lieutenant and the FO. I was the Escort for the Private. The next of kin
            of the three soldiers chose Grand Rapids, Michigan as a central part of the
            country as their final resting place with a grave marker bearing all three
            names. Fitting they served together, crashed and died together and were buried
            together for eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
            One
            thing that sticks in my mind was the way in which the patriotism waned in the
            three short years. In 1947 when the program first started everybody
            volunteered to assist with the burial details. The city mayors would show up
            with other dignitaries to have their photos taken for the newspapers. The
            seven man firing squads always had back-ups available on short notice. Buglers
            were easy to find. But in, 1949, the third and final year it was difficult to
            round up enough men, to the point where I would go to the VFW and American
            Legion club houses to ask for support.
        </p>
        <p>
            In
            the three years of this honored and solemn duty, many men served in our Escort
            Company. Some stayed and many moved on after but a few trips. Our over-sized
            Company swelled to 603 assigned on 31 January 1949 at the peak of the program.
            At the deactivation of the 5012<sup>th</sup> ASU, Escort Company, Fort Sheridan, Illinois on 20 October
            1949, we had escorted the remains of 22,326 soldiers through the
            Chicago Depot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ironically,
            a large percent of the Regular army men who served as Escorts would be in
            combat in less than nine months in Korea fighting for their lives. Many lost their lives in this “Police
            Action”
            conflict and in time, their remains were escorted to their homes for burial. I
            am proud to have served with each one of them. They were soldiers all.
