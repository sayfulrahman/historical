    <p><b>DIARY ENTRY #26</b></p>
    <h1 class="center">ONE COLD MORNING</h1>
    <p class="center"><i><b> By Don R. Marsh</b></i></p>
    <p>It is always the coldest just before daybreak, that
        particular morning it was even colder than I could ever recall. The coldness of
        my feet troubled me almost as much as my hands, as my fingers were already numb
        from holding my gun at the ready.
    </p>
    <p>I nervously chambered a round and clicked off the safety
        catch. Now it was wait time. Waiting for the expected moment of decision when to
        pull the trigger, hoping I wouldn't flinch from the expected muzzle blast and
        the stock toe slamming into my shoulder. Just trying to suppress the overanxious
        feeling became taxing. The adrenaline began pumping as the long awaited action
        was about to begin. We crouched in silence waiting for the first shot to be
        fired. Coping with the frigid temperature meant stamping my feet in the cold
        boots to maintain circulation.
    </p>
    <p>My buddy Larry wise-cracked, &quot;Don't shoot until you
        see the whites of their eyes!&quot; I thought he's nuts if he thinks I'm going
        to sit and wait until they get that close. Their scouts were approaching as we
        all strained in the semi-darkness to pick up the leaders. The word was passed
        not to begin shooting until they were well within range. As I pressed my cheek
        to the ice-cold stock, the misty vapors from my rapid breathing momentarily
        clouded the rear sight blotting out the front sight.
    </p>
    <p>I found myself repeatedly double checking to make sure
        that I had clicked the safety off to avoid that gut-wrenching feeling of pulling
        the trigger and having nothing happen.
    </p>
    <p>Patience was never one of my virtues and at the last
        moment I leaped to my feet and fired at the leaders. Then all hell broke loose.
        Firing erupted all around me and the odor of cordite quickly filled the air. Off
        to my right, the others were firing too. Soon I could hear lead whizzing
        overhead from the cross fire.
    </p>
    <p>I fired off all my initial rounds and quickly reloaded to
        resume shooting at the fleeing silhouettes. The barrel grew too hot to touch and
        suddenly as it began it became quiet as the firing died out. Over the ringing in
        my ears, I could barely hear the others' voices as we vacated our camouflaged
        holes to count the kill. Our small group were all &quot;old-timers&quot; and
        rather nonchalant about their achievements that morning.
    </p>
    <p>The sun was rising on the start of another good hunt day
        at our private hunting club near the Salton Sea in Southern California.
