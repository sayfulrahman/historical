  </span>The First Soldier Len Mainiero called off our names one by one from his
  ever present clip board he habitually carried, handed our 201 Personnel
  folders over to a Corporal in Charge, turned and walked away without saying a
  word. It was over.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">My two well-traveled duffel bags were tossed in the back
  of the GI truck. I was ready for the short ride to our next destination –
  the Tidworth British Barracks, home of the “Hell On Wheels” Second Armored
  Division. A small circle of old friends from the 143<sup>rd</sup> Signal
  gathered around for one last goodbye: including Harry Tuttle, Norm Steele, Ken
  Speers, Sergeant Murdo McCleod and even my old nemesis from our Liberty ship
  travels, Sergeant Herman Moeller, from Brooklyn. He couldn’t resist giving
  me the needle one more time and still would not admit that I had beat him at
  his own game. A bit of one up-man-ship on my part, as I told him he’d have
  to find someone new to shadow. Laughingly I gave him the finger. After
  handshakes all around, I hopped in the back of the truck and snapped off a
  smart hand salute. Adios, amigos. See you in the Bulge.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">A new day was dawning. I am
  escaping from the odds-on jaws of death in the 36<sup>th</sup> Infantry into
  the command of an officer so aggressive and reckless in combat that even his
  own staff feared for their safety – Brigadier General Maurice Rose, CG,
  Combat Command “A.”<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">The trucks entered Highway 303
  and wound through villages and small towns of Wincanton, Deptford and Amesbury
  arriving at the British peacetime regular army cavalry barracks at Tidworth on
  the Salisbury Plains. At the Main Gate, MPs checked the driver’s trip ticket
  and passed us on through. We pulled up in front of the 142<sup>nd</sup> Signal
  Company Orderly where the Corporal with our records went in as we jumped down
  from the trucks.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">A call to the Wire Section and
  a Staff Sergeant Harry T. Hall came by soon to escort us to the wiremen’s
  barracks. The two story red brick buildings – <i>with windows -- </i>were a
  welcome sight after the six months at the Spartan-life 143<sup>rd</sup> Signal
  Company mushroom ranch. The Wire Section’s second floor housed double deck
  bunks with real, albeit 3 inch GI mattresses! I hadn’t seen those since we
  left Camp Shanks in October.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">Sergeant Hall told us to grab
  a bunk and settle in until he sent for us. A Corporal eventually came by to
  escort us to the Supply Room to draw two blankets for the sacks. No more
  roughing it on hard wooden boards – these were real GI cots with springs!
  Unfortunately, as luck would have it, we didn’t get to make use them very
  long. The trip to the Battalion size Mess Hall was a far different experience
  from the past six months in that the cooks had use of a bona fide kitchen
  instead of a makeshift field cook stove setup. The food was GI just the same.
  However, we ate out of our mess kits, as this still was the US Army. A trip to
  the shower room later was a shear pleasure – endless hot water, which we
  hadn’t experienced since leaving the States. They had a movie theater with
  nightly showings. A small well-stocked PX was available. We were back in the
  real world once again with “all the comforts of home.” -- but for how
  long?<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">The CO of the 142<sup>nd</sup>
  Armored Signal Company was Captain Henry J. Stuart, whom we never saw.
  Instead, we reported directly to his Wire Officer, 1<sup>st</sup> Lt. Nixon
  McNeil for assignments the next day. McNeil had my record jacket in front of
  him as I saluted and gave him my name. He sized me up as his decision had
  already been made. He simply said, “Marsh, I’m assigning you to Sergeant
  Jones’ Combat Command A wire team. You are going TDY (Temporary Duty
  Assignment) and will remain there until further notice (fifteen months later)!
  You will be a troubleshooter in the jeep with Corporal William Veno. Report to
  Technical Sergeant Tom McFarland, the Wire Chief, when you leave here.
  That’s all.”<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">The full Wire Section under
  T/Sergeant Tom McFarland and his assistant, S/Sergeant Harry T. Hall, had
  served together since 1940 in the States, North Africa and Sicily and were the
  leaders of a close-knit group of older men. Breaking into that tight circle
  would be difficult if not impossible. We would remain strangers for the
  remainder of the war. As it turned out, except on one or two occasions after
  we landed in France, I never saw any of them again. My life would now be
  totally focused on my new wire team under Sergeant Earlie J. Jones from
  Andalusia, Alabama; Corporal William J. Veno from Superior, Wisconsin; Private
  Douglas (Cajon Joe) Elfer from New Orleans, Louisiana; Private Fred J. Newland
  from Harlan County, Kentucky; Private Clovis Waldroop from Salinas, Oklahoma
  and the man who became my close friend and fox hole buddy, Private First Class
  Lawrence A. Hull, from Boston, Massachusetts. Both Hull and myself were
  promoted to Privates First Class immediately after arriving in the 142<sup>nd</sup>
  Signal that week. Recognition we had failed to receive from Captain Wilson.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">Our wire team reported
  directly to the CCA Communications Officer, 1<sup>st</sup> Lt. Walter S. Moll
  from Indianapolis, Indiana. Before entering the Army, Moll had been a seminary
  applicant for priesthood. Upon reaching the three-year-fork-in-the-road, he
  was faced with making the crucial decision – in or out. He opted out of
  becoming a priest for a civilian life and went to college. Was drafted,
  applied for OCS and commissioned at Camp Crowder, Missouri as a Signal Corps
  Lieutenant. Joined the Second armored Division in Sicily and served under BG
  Rose as his Signal Officer. He would be our day-to-day OIC (Officer In Charge)
  for the foreseeable future without any other contact with the Signal Company
  personnel. He was the boss.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>I
  never once heard him curse or use God’s name in vain. When truly angered,
  most of the time with me, he would exclaim, “Jimmy crickets (instead of
  Jesus Christ) Marsh, don’t argue with me!” The man couldn’t read a map
  to save his life – or ours, which frequently put us all in jeopardy, is why
  I would get into heated discussions with him. But he turned out to be “one
  of the good guys” who would share his liquor ration with us, unlike the
  other officers.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">The Second Armored Division
  was given the name “Hell On Wheels” by a Lt. Haynes Dugan from the Public
  Information Office, then under Major General George S Patton, when he
  commanded the division in 1940. Patton was one of several famous generals to
  lead the division over time, including: MG Charles L. Scott, MG Willis D.
  Crittenberger, MG Ernest N. Harman, MG High J. Kingman, MG Hugh J. Gaffey and
  MG Edward H. Brooks. Brooks was our Division Commanding General on my arrival.
  My favorite 2AD Division Commanding Officer was MG Ernest “Old Gravel
  Voice” Harmon, whom General Omar Bradley said; “<i>The profane and
  hot-tempered Ernest N. Harmon</i> <i>brought the corps the rare combination of
  sound tactical judgment and boldness that together make a great commander.
  More than any other division commander in North Africa, he was constantly and
  brilliantly aggressive; in Europe he was to become our most outstanding tank
  commander.”</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Col. John W.
  Mountcastle quotes that in the Armor Magazine –March-April 1988. Harmon was
  in command when the division landed in North Africa. Colonel Maurice Rose was
  his Chief of Staff – both were temporarily assigned to the 1<sup>st</sup>
  Armored Division when it faltered in the North African Campaign and required
  new leadership.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">Payday arrived on the last day
  in May and I witnessed something that would never have occurred in the 143<sup>rd</sup>
  Signal Company – open gambling at tables in the bright sunlight in the
  courtyard of the Company area. The Company grade officers strode among the
  tables watching the crapshooters and poker players exchanging monies. One, a
  brand new Second Lieutenant Ernest Miller had been the former Company First
  Sergeant and received a direct commission. Replaced by Sgt.Robert Koch. In the
  143<sup>rd</sup> Signal, Captain Wilson had reduced one of his NCOs for
  gambling with Privates – here it was anybody’s game and open to all.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">In addition to wire, the CCA
  Communication Section had the Command radio half-track commanded by Staff
  Sergeant Thomas D. Spiers from Picayune, Mississippi; two radio operators, T/5
  William Pruitt from La Porte, Indiana and Pvt. Vern Evans from Jackson,
  Mississippi, plus the driver, T/5 Harold Zappendorf from Chicago, Illinois. I
  never got acquainted with the other Signalmen in the Message Center as our
  paths never crossed and I didn’t know any of their names. All reported to
  Lt. Walter Moll.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">When we arrived at Tidworth,
  the whole division was already into a lock-down and no one received any passes
  for leave or to go into the nearby towns. It was no secret the Second Armored
  Division would be one of several divisions included in the initial invasion
  forces. We were loaded and waiting for the word from General Eisenhower.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">Now it was time to sit and
  wait. Sergeant Harry Hall assembled the wiremen and told us time was short –
  hours away, we would be on Standby from here on in. We were then told to get a
  GI buzz-cut white-wall haircut and write “the last letter home” which
  would be held for posting until we went out the gate heading for the docks of
  Southampton. I went off to be by myself to write the three obligatory letters.
  Wrote to my folks and said basically not to worry that I had the luck of the
  Irish looking out for me and really in no danger as I was in a “headquarters
  unit.” My mother wanted to believe it, but it didn’t fool my father who
  had fought as a Sergeant in an Infantry Company in World War One.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><font face="Arial">Next I wrote to
  “the girl back home” asking her to promise to wait for me, but if I
  didn’t come back -- to find someone else; which she did anyway -- while I
  was gone.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><font face="Arial">The
  other letter was to my favorite of my four brothers, my older brother Bob at
  home. I wrote, “By the way, Bob, you have first pickins on anything of mine
  if I am unlucky enough to be planted on this side of the pond, not much, but
  you’re welcome to whatever it is. This is it – so long chum – I’ll
  write when ever I have time and when the spirit moves me. Best of Everything
  to all. Your Bro. Don”<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">On the morning of 1 June 1944,
  BG Maurice Rose, CG of CCA and the Advance Command Post left Tidworth and
  joined the 9<sup>th</sup> Infantry Regiment, 2<sup>nd</sup> Infantry Division
  in the marshalling area of Barry, Wales. The balance of the Command remained
  at Tidworth. The Advance CP of CCA preceded the Combat Command to Normandy,
  France, landing at St. Lurent-sur-Mer on 7 June 1944.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><font face="Arial">Parts of the general
  orders were “do not keep envelopes containing our military postal address,
  unit references, no photos, and above all – no diaries.” The latter could
  have presented a slight problem for myself, but many of us totally ignored it.
  I stuffed the essential contraband in a compartment of the jeep. We were under
  wraps, so all shoulder patches had to be removed and the Division
  identification markings on vehicles had to be painted over.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><font face="Arial">While waiting, we
  were subjected to one more “shakedown” inspection of our field packs.
  Anything unauthorized was tossed. Hiding forbidden items wasn’t too
  difficult – we simply put them in our vehicles! The Company Armorer, Cpl.
  Vince Smedley, had issued me my 30 cal. carbine rifle, with extra ammunition
  magazines, which required a trip to the rifle range to zero in the weapon. The
  live ammo distribution would wait until just before our convoy went out the
  gate enroute to the dock area. The word came to “Mount Up”-- our jeep and
  small ¾ ton weapons carrier-wire truck joined the long parade of armored
  vehicles headed to the sea like lemmings.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">We loaded on to our LST
  (Landing Ship Tank) #1009 at the Southampton dock late in the afternoon on D
  Plus 2, June 8<sup>th</sup>. I felt lucky to be assigned to the jeep with Cpl.
  Bill Veno who was already a veteran of the North Africa and Sicily Campaigns
  without so much as receiving a scratch, thus far. Unfortunately, his luck ran
  out a few months later as he hoped to beat the odds. Months later, while I was
  driving and he was seated next to me, a shell exploded close to us and a
  fragment hit him. It pierced his helmet and forehead an inch above his right
  eye. Life is a matter of inches, a few inches either way and everything
  changes. Who has the answer?<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">Veno carefully backed our jeep
  into the LST as directed. The jeep was in combat ready condition; the engine
  “waterproofed.” The canvas top down and strapped to the hood covering the
  canvas-covered windshield on the jeep hood. We felt naked sitting among our
  armored plated tanks and half-tracks of our landing force. They were armed
  with cannons, 30 and 50 caliber machine guns compared to my 30-caliber carbine
  and Veno’s Thompson’s sub-machine gun. The bow ramp was raised and cranked
  closed as the LST backed away from the dock. We were confined below decks and
  ordered to remain there until ordered otherwise. I found a loose abandoned GI
  blanket and stretched out on a catwalk in the hold. Now it was left to the
  individual and his own thoughts and religious beliefs. At this moment in time,
  I could not resist recalling the words used by our President Franklin Delano
  Roosevelt in one of his fireside radio speeches to the country when he spoke
  “<b>No American boy shall set foot on foreign soil.” </b>That lying
  son-of-a-bitch! The trip across the Channel was bumpy in the choppy seas.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><font face="Arial">Apparently it was
  dark as the ship’s Captain ran the bow on the bottom at the designated spot,
  St. Laurent-sur-Mer, on Omaha Red Easy Beach. We would have to sit and wait
  out the night for the receding tide before we would get the signal to open the
  bow doors and off load. Suddenly, without any warning, the deck anti-aircraft
  guns, comprised of quad .50s and 20mm Bofors started firing incessantly. The
  steady drone of heavy engines told us Kraut bombers were making bomb runs and
  attacking. The empty shell casings and constant plink of shell fragments
  hitting the deck continued off and on all night until morning. Some serious
  stuff was taking place topside -- which we knew for certain, heightened the
  tension and anxiety.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="LINE-HEIGHT: normal"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>At
  the first light of dawn, things began popping.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>We had orders to mount up and start engines. Slowly the bow doors began
  opening followed by the ramp being lowered simultaneously. Following belching
  fumes and squealing track bogie wheels ahead of us, we slowly moved to the
  head of the line at the ramp on the bow. When we did, I received an eye
  opening shock as I looked down the ramp and saw nothing but water and no
  pebble filled beach! It looked like we still had another fifty yards of water
  to reach the shoreline. Veno eased the jeep down into the water at the signal
  go. We managed to travel 5 yards, with the water reaching the engine block
  when the motor sputtered and died. We were blocking the route to shore. Veno
  ground the starter to no avail. The distributor waterproofing failed and
  shorted out the ignition. Within minutes a Beach Master’s stand-by huge
  caterpillar dozer hooked a chain to the front bumper and dragged us ashore.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">Everywhere the beach scene was
  a beehive of activity. Wrecked tanks, LCIs (Landing Craft Infantry) boats
  overturned and mangled vehicles of all sorts. In addition, barbed wire
  obstacles with I-beam steel anti-tank barricades were scattered all over the
  beach. Useless tube life preserver belts by thousands with other flotsam
  floated in and out with the tide, touching the shoreline littering the beach.
  The Graves Registration teams were already busy laying out rows of neatly
  tagged dead GIs, waiting for disposition. Kraut prisoners of war were under
  guard in MP barbed wire enclosures. It was a very sobering scene to see.
  Crates of ammo of all types, reels of telephone wire, stacks of jerry cans of
  gasoline and boxes of rations were being stock piled by the beach crews. We
  quickly cleaned and dried the coil. We restarted the jeep engine to join our
  column moving up the draw through Exit Number One with our adrenalin was
  racing through our veins.<span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">The convoy drove to a wooded
  assembly area in the vicinity of Mosles, France.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Guides assigned us areas to “de-waterproof” our vehicles and erect
  camouflage nets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A perimeter
  defense was established as arriving unit commanders were coordinating with the
  Advance Staff to await further orders from Division. Although the beachhead
  had been littered with the debris of war, the top side of the bank overlooking
  the shoreline appeared to have sustained much less carnage that I would have
  imagined in those circumstances from the aerial bombing and off shore naval
  ships’ pounding by their 16 inch shells from the battleships and the rest of
  the armada heavy guns.&nbsp;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </font>
  </p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><font face="Arial">Gaping holes from bombing were
  everywhere, along with recently dug and empty foxholes. The area was littered
  with the debris of war of all types. A British Spitfire fighter plane had
  landed with wheels up and suffered only minor damage to the under carriage,
  probably a dead-stick landing that the pilot walked away from, apparently
  without injury. Ironically, nearby in a foxhole was a dead GI from the 2<sup>nd</sup>
  Infantry Division, still cradling his M1 Garand rifle. The Graves Registration
  men had been hard at work locating and tagging the dead GIs, but had not yet
  totally swept this area. As if I need convincing, the grim sight left no doubt
  this war was real.<i><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
