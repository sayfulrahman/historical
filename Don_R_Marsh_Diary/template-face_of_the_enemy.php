    <h1 class="center">THE FACE OF THE ENEMY</h1>
    <p  class="center"><b><i>By Don R. Marsh</i></b></p>
    <p>28 July 1944</p>
    <p>St. Lo Breakout</p>
    <p>Our
        Combat Command “A” was detached from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division
        and operated directly under XIX Corps with the 13<sup>th</sup> Cavalry Group
        attached. The Corps St. Lo Breakout objective was to seize the area along the
        route of Villebaudon-Percy-Monterey-St. Sever-de-Calvados. The road between
        the towns Villabaudon and Percy were under heavy fire from anti-tank guns,
        Screaming Meemies rocket fire and artillery. The enemy attempted to infiltrate
        across the road from East to West between the two towns and set up hasty road
        blocks along the road with numerous anti-tank
        guns. The enemy had cut the road, but was driven back after fierce fire
        fights. Our force attacking Percy terminated the attack at 2150. Nightly
        attacks were made on our command by enemy bomber aircraft using flares to
        locate our columns.</p>

    <p>We
        drove into a field for the night and set up a perimeter defense. Small arms fire from near by fields from Kraut
        burp guns told us the
        enemy was still present and had not retreated. As soon as the vehicles were
        covered with camouflage nets we dug our foxholes for the night as exhaustion
        from the lack of sleep over-came us.</p>
    <p>Long
        before dawn we were required to be up and ready to roll with a moments notice
        so eating a cold K-ration was the daily ritual. Coffee, cigarettes and
        K-rations were the staples of the day. Our Commander BG Maurice Rose existed
        on the same fare only with much less sleep. Each vehicle was issued a portable
        small single burner gasoline stove used for heating a cup of water to which we
        added a package of instant coffee; that is when we were stopped long enough to
        heat a cup. When your turn with the stove came you would wait until the water
        boiled and add the contents of the coffee packet, then burn your lips from the
        mess kit cup used to heat the water – another daily practice.</p>
    <p>It was during one of these early morning moments that a French civilian appeared
        in our bivouac area excitedly babbling in French something that I could not
        understand. When we got him to calm down and speak slowly I picked up on the
        words, “Le boche” – their hated term for the Germans. When I asked him
        “ou” (where), he replied, “Ici” (here) waving his arms the direction
        of the other side of the hedgerow behind which we were standing. Holy shit! I
        then grabbed my carbine expecting a Kraut to appear at the top of the
        embankment at any moment. Joe Elfer, our Cajun from New Orleans, who only spoke New Orleans French, asked him
        for details. The French
        civilian pointed to a path leading around the hedgerow, indicating for us to
        follow him.</p>
    <p>At this point, alarms went off in my head that he might be a German sympathizer
        setting us up for an ambush, so it was decided to only send four of us to
        investigate. Bill Veno carried a Thompson sub-machine gun, so along with him,
        Larry Hull, Joe Elfer and I crawled up the pathway following the Frenchman.
        Breaking out into the open of the next field bordered by hedgerows on all four
        sides, we cautiously peered into the field in the direction he was pointing.
        About 25 yards away we spotted a lone German soldier with the upper part of
        his body exposed from his fox hole with his arms raised in surrender. A
        typical ruse used by the Krauts to sucker unsuspecting Americans out in to the
        open and then his comrades would suddenly pop up from hidden camouflaged holes
        and open fire on us. A hurried decision to go forward or not and it was
        decided that Veno and I would go forward part way as the others covered us -
        then the last ten yards I’d go alone, so as to cut our losses if it was a
        ruse.</p>
    <p>I am a communications wire man, not a combat infantryman wearing a CIB and
        wanting to be a hero, but here was a chance to bring in a live prisoner who
        might render valuable intelligence. So I went for it. Crouching low and
        keeping my carbine aimed at him all the time, I crawled within a few feet of
        him and stopped. Kneeling, I beckoned for him to rise up out of his hole and
        as he stood up, I did as well. He still wore his helmet, which bothered me as
        most willing prisoners shed the helmet quickly in a show of cooperation, but
        he didn’t. He was wearing the triangle camouflage cape over the top of his
        uniform as many of the enemy infantry did. His rifle lay on the ground next to
        his hole, but he never looked at it nor took his eyes off of me. It was then
        as we stood a yard apart that I looked into his eyes and saw not fear -- but
        utter sheer terror. One can only imagine the thoughts racing through his mind
        - would he be shot, tortured or was I going to kill him on the spot. In his
        right hand he held a palm sized photograph of a woman and two small children,
        I gathered they were his wife and kids as he repeated over and over “mein Frau und kinder, bitte” - my
        wife and kids, please. The tears began
        rolling down his cheeks as I moved to get around behind him to prod him
        towards the way we came. I guess as the carbine poked him in the back he
        thought any moment this was it.</p>
    <p>Reaching
        the bivouac area I was directed to take him to see Major Crust, our
        Intelligence Officer. Major Crust quickly summoned one of his German
        translators and before they began questioning him, Crust flipped up his
        triangle camouflage cover and there in the front of his belt was a potato
        masher hand grenade! Sweet Jesus, I had fucked up royal, in that I failed to
        pat him down. To say that Crust ripped me a new asshole is putting it mildly.
        If the army ever gave out stupid medals I earned one that day, and with a
        bonus cluster. After they questioned the new POW, they instructed me to see
        that he was sent to the rear with a guard to the MP’s POW pen.</p>
    <p>Lo’
        and behold, at that moment, up popped our French civilian with the Kraut’s
        rifle, retrieved from the field, slung over his shoulder who volunteered to
        take him off our hands and walk him back down to the rear to meet MPs on the
        road following our route. Having
        passed that task off we soon mounted up and began to move out. We were not
        back on the road more than 5 minutes but who the hell do we see standing by
        the side of the road going <i>forward</i>,
        but the Frenchman - all alone! So what happened to “Herman the German”?
        Did he get to the rear? Did the Frog shoot him? Did he ever make it back home
        to his frau and kinder? Some how I hope he did make it back home, as I did.
        Perhaps today somewhere in Germany, maybe Wolfenbuttel, are members of his family who might want to know
        that I
        am the guy who remembers their “Grossvater”- the German Soldier with the unforgettable face. Just another
        one of
        those mysteries and fortunes of war to which we will never know the answer.</p>
