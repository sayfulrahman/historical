                    Combat Command “A” was detached from the 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division
                    and operated directly under XIX Corps with the 13<sup>th</sup> Cavalry Group
                    attached. The Corps St. Lo Breakout objective was to seize the area along the
                    route of Villebaudon-Percy-Monterey-St. Sever-de-Calvados. The road between
                    the towns Villabaudon and Percy were under heavy fire from anti-tank guns,
                    Screaming Meemies rocket fire and artillery. The enemy attempted to infiltrate
                    across the road from East to West between the two towns and set up hasty road
                    blocks along the road with numerous<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>anti-tank
                    guns. The enemy had cut the road, but was driven back after fierce fire
                    fights. Our force attacking Percy terminated the attack at 2150. Nightly
                    attacks were made on our command by enemy bomber aircraft using flares to

                    before dawn we were required to be up and ready to roll with a moments notice
                    so eating a cold K-ration was the daily ritual. Coffee, cigarettes and
                    K-rations were the staples of the day. Our Commander BG Maurice Rose existed
                    on the same fare only with much less sleep. Each vehicle was issued a portable
                    small single burner gasoline stove used for heating a cup of water to which we
                    added a package of instant coffee; that is when we were stopped long enough to
                    heat a cup. When your turn with the stove came you would wait until the water
                    boiled and add the contents of the coffee packet, then burn your lips from the
                    mess kit cup used to heat the water – another daily practice. <o:p>

                    was during one of these early morning moments that a French civilian appeared
                    in our bivouac area excitedly babbling in French something that I could not
                    understand. When we got him to calm down and speak slowly I picked up on the
                    words,  “Le boche” – their hated term for the Germans. When I asked him
                    “ou” (where), he replied, “Ici” (here) waving his arms the direction
                    of the other side of the hedgerow behind which we were standing. Holy shit! I
                    then grabbed my carbine expecting a Kraut to appear at the top of the
                    embankment at any moment. Joe Elfer, our Cajun from <st1:place w:st="on">

                    , who only spoke New Orleans French, asked him for details. The French
                    civilian pointed to a path leading around the hedgerow, indicating for us to
                    follow him. <o:p>

                <font face="Arial">At
                    this point, alarms went off in my head that he might be a German sympathizer
                    setting us up for an ambush, so it was decided to only send four of us to
                    investigate. Bill Veno carried a Thompson sub-machine gun, so along with him,
                    Larry Hull, Joe Elfer and I crawled up the pathway following the Frenchman.
                    Breaking out into the open of the next field bordered by hedgerows on all four
                    sides, we cautiously peered into the field in the direction he was pointing.
                    About 25 yards away we spotted a lone German soldier with the upper part of
                    his body exposed from his fox hole with his arms raised in surrender. A
                    typical ruse used by the Krauts to sucker unsuspecting Americans out in to the
                    open and then his comrades would suddenly pop up from hidden camouflaged holes
                    and open fire on us. A hurried decision to go forward or not and it was
                    decided that Veno and I would go forward part way as the others covered us -
                    then the last ten yards I’d go alone, so as to cut our losses if it was a
                    ruse.<o:p>

                    wanting to be a hero, but here was a chance to bring in a live prisoner who
                    might render valuable intelligence. So I went for it. Crouching low and
                    keeping my carbine aimed at him all the time, I crawled within a few feet of
                    him and stopped. Kneeling, I beckoned for him to rise up out of his hole and
                    as he stood up, I did as well. He still wore his helmet, which bothered me as
                    most willing prisoners shed the helmet quickly in a show of cooperation, but
                    he didn’t. He was wearing the triangle camouflage cape over the top of his
                    uniform as many of the enemy infantry did. His rifle lay on the ground next to
                    his hole, but he never looked at it nor took his eyes off of me. It was then
                    as we stood a yard apart that I looked into his eyes and saw not fear -- but
                    utter sheer terror. One can only imagine the thoughts racing through his mind
                    - would he be shot, tortured or was I going to kill him on the spot. In his
                    right hand he held a palm sized photograph of a woman and two small children,
                    I gathered they were his wife and kids as he repeated over and over “mein Frau und kinder, bitte” - my wife and kids, please. The tears began
                    rolling down his cheeks as I moved to get around behind him to prod him
                    towards the way we came. I guess as the carbine poked him in the back he
                    thought any moment this was it. <o:p>

                    Intelligence Officer. Major Crust quickly summoned one of his German
                    translators and before they began questioning him, Crust flipped up his
                    triangle camouflage cover and there in the front of his belt was a potato
