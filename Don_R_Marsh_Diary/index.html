  <p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font face="Verdana">On
  September 4, 1942 I had turned twenty years of age. Although it would be at
  least one year or more before I would be eligible to receive a Selective
  Service Board draft notice, in keeping with family tradition, as my father and
  his father had done before me, I made the decision to volunteer to enlist in
  the U.S. Army. This would allow sufficient time for me to sell my car and wrap
  up my personal affairs with the tentative enlistment date of December 1<sup>st</sup>
  in mind. At the time I was employed by the J.I. Case Company, <st1:City w:st="on">
  Racine</st1:City>
  , <st1:State 
w:st="on">
  Wisconsin</st1:State>
  as a milling machine operator milling tank links; these are the connecting
  links on the tracks of the <st1:City

  <st1:place w:st="on">

  tank. As had many of my friends and former classmates at <st1:place w:st="on">

w:st="on">
  Horlick</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
  High School</st1:PlaceType>
  </st1:place>
  , I had aspirations of becoming an aerial gunner on a B-17. Joining the Air
  Corps would end my remote affiliation with tanks and tanks parts, or so I
  thought. While this disconnect was in the back of my mind, I never gave much
  consideration that these idle thoughts would come back to haunt me within a
  year.</font></p>

  daily local newspaper kept the city aware of who had entered the Aviation
  Cadets or the Aerial Gunnery schools and were undergoing training with their
  photos of the candidates in brown leather flight jackets accented with a white
  parachute scarves, wearing leather flying helmets, with goggles attached on
  top. No doubt this patriotic publicity attracted many applicants, myself
  included. After a few visits to the Army Recruiting Office in the <st1:place w:st="on">

  , I was convinced this was my choice and earnestly inquired about the
  qualifications. With only a high school diploma I did not qualify for Cadet
  Training, at the time, and so I settled on the Aerial Gunner program. The Army
  Sergeant advised me up front that there was no guarantee that I would be
  assigned to the Air Corps, as my enlistment would specifically be in the
  “Army of the <st1:country-region 
w:st="on">
  <st1:place w:st="on">
  United States</st1:place>
  </st1:country-region>
  , for the duration, plus six months -- <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">unassigned</i></b>.”
  <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>However, as a typical Recruiter
  would promise, the Sergeant said that anyone who requested enlisted flying
  status would have “no problem” being accepted, for everyone on flying
  status had to be a volunteer. Being in good health without vision problems or
  corrections required, I wishfully assumed that I would soon be at an airfield
  in <st1:State

  , or <st1:State w:st="on">

  remaining days and nights slipped away rapidly and soon the end of November
  had arrived. Being single and unattached spared me the need of asking anyone
  special to “wait for me.” Came the morning of December 1<sup>st</sup>, my

  civilian life, while expected to be placed on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">temporary

  1, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">1974, </b>that<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">
  </b>I received my final discharge from military service to the country. From
  this day forward of my enlistment all decisions, both minor and major, would
  be made for me by others, whether I agreed or disagreed, as the military is
  not a democracy. This latter point would be hammered home to me on all too
  many occasions in the decades to come as I later pondered each new set of
  superiors, duty assignments, circumstances and situations. Admittedly, a
  difficult challenge for one who had<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>been
  a “free-thinker” and not used to the strict regimentation of military life
  dealing with mundane routines and repetitive asinine instructions, and often
  rendered in a threatening manner by my superiors. Along with the ever present
  silent command of,”Comply or else!” But, I suspected all this when I
  volunteered and raised my hand in taking the Oath of Enlistment accepting
  orders from all those commissioned and non-commissioned appointed over me.</font></p>

  A, 33<sup>rd</sup> Signal Corps Training Battalion on the other side of the
  Post. While undergoing additional military indoctrination of viewing training
  films and attending lectures, we would be attending night classes at the same
  time on a monthly rotation basis. The dual schedule consisted of Monday
  through Friday, while Saturday mornings were reserved for the standard
  barracks inspections. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Our days
  began with Reveille at 0600 hours followed by four hours during the a.m. of
  training followed by six hours of schooling until 2000 hours (8 p.m.) for a
  long grueling 14 hour day. Fighting sleep in class was a challenge as the
  instructors droned on and on in monotone explanations and instructions of
  amperage, electrons, ohms, volts, resistors, circuits, tubes, VHF receivers
  and transmitters, wave lengths, wattage, current -- positives and negatives,
  continuity, conduction and a myriad of electronic technical terms studied and
  read from an Army Signal Corps manual. The military instructors stood at their
  desks and blackboards with a yard long wooden ½” dowel rod with an empty
  brass .45 caliber shell casing attached to the end. The moment the NCO
  instructor saw a dozing student’s head bobbing and chin resting on his chest
  he would walk up silently and tap the sleeping soldier on the head with the
  brass end of the pointer. All of us suffered the rap of the .45 shell casing
  more than once during the night classes. The seeds of resentment had their
  beginning in this style class instruction.</font></p>

  wasn’t long before the warm weather arrived and my thoughts turned to
  outdoors and other possible pursuits – namely, escaping from this school
  before I passed the point of no return in this ten month course. Luckily I
  found the sympathetic ear of my Electronics Instructor by the name of 1<sup>st</sup>
  Lt. Auriello Santa Ana. I explained that I had enlisted for the Air Corps
  Aerial Gunnery program and instead was shuffled into radio repair. Whether it
  was the Army’s way of putting the square peg in the round hole or just a
  case of burn-out, I convinced him that I wasn’t suited for this technician
  bench work future. By being up front and explaining my candid lack of interest
  in becoming a Radio Repairman for the duration that working with tube testers,
  ohm meters, walkie-talkie hand held radios, VHF radio chassis and soldering
  irons had become a boring way of life and I needed a change. He then advised
  me on how to submit a voluntary request for a withdrawal from the class and a
  transfer to another field. After a week on hold, the school headquarters
  processed the request with orders transferring me to the <st1:place w:st="on">

  on the other side of the Post was conducted in an area the size of a football
  field with dozens of wooden 30 and 40 foot tall telephone poles implanted
  about ten feet apart. This was the outdoor classroom. The pole climbing class
  would have to wait until we had learned about the different types of wire
  ranging from the small handheld reel of Infantry combat wire to the larger
  jeep/truck reels of standard W-110 field wire. One class involved the use of
  the basic field telephone, known as the EE8A. It was the standard issue to
  troops in the field in combat, using a hand crank with handset in a leather
  case. It was destined to later become one of my constant companions. We were
  taught how to field strip the wire and make a splice using the square knot and
  friction tape. The TL-9 leather case containing a pair of side cutter pliers
  and a folding pocket knife; this was standard issue to all wiremen and carried
  on the web waist belt.</font></p>

  yard class separated the men from the boys. We strapped on Lamon steel
  spur-climbers to the inside of our leg from the instep of the heel of our shoe
  to just below our knee joint. The safety belt was not hooked around the pole
  as you climbed up until you had reached the top – then you would unsnap the
  keeper on the belt and circle it around the back of the pole to your other
  hand and then hook it onto your belt. It was also the “tool rack” for
  carrying extra hand tools and became the “seat” after you had reached the
  top of the pole. Climbing the pole was altogether another challenge. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>After
  months of daily class wear, the creosote coated wooden poles had become a mass
  of slivers from top to bottom. We were issued heavy leather gloves to lightly
  grasp the sides of the pole as we kicked the sharp 1½ inch steel spur into
  the wood and straightened our leg to stand, alternating each <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><u>straight
  </u></i>leg as we went up. The trick was to keep your weight on one lower leg
  straight with that spur dug into the wood. Bend the lower leg and the spur
  would fail to hold and down you went! We were taught not to look down at your
  feet, but to look up where you could see what was above you. The Nervous
  Nellys would freeze half way up the pole and the instructor would climb up
  under the recruit and try to quiet his fears and to stop him from hugging the
  pole. By the time the recruit got down from the pole, more often as not, his
  face had souvenir splinters imbedded. Those of us who quickly mastered the
  climbing were then given a basketball to toss back and forth while
  “seated” in the safety belt – all this built confidence and became easy
  as one-two-three. Lost in the details was that in <st1:place w:st="on">
  Europe</st1:place>
  they used concrete and metal poles -- not wood. The six week course ended and
  I was given the Army Military Occupation Specialty number MOS 641, Field
  Lineman. Ready for my next assignment.</font></p>
