            near Palenberg, Germany and attacked east through Ubach, seizing Baesweiler and
            Beggendorf by 7 October 1944, despite heavy resistance by all arms. Didtweiler
            was also secured. CC“A” remained in a defensive role until 16 November 1944;
            during this period the Command patrolled actively at night and employed
            systematic fire by massed artillery to inflict heavy casualties and destruction
            on the enemy, in addition to disrupting supply and their communications. Dug-in
            tanks, tank destroyers and infantry held the front line, while defeating and
            destroying numerous enemy patrols and raiding parties. </span>&nbsp;<o:p>

    <font face="Arial">Brigadier General Collier, CC“A” CG, ordered Lt. Moll
        to have the wire team run wire to these forward units. Realizing the danger for
        the wiremen, General Collier ordered an M-8 Greyhound Recon car from the 82<sup>nd</sup>
        Recon and an M-5 Stuart light tank from the 66<sup>th</sup> AR for protection as
        we ran the lines into German territory. The two armored vehicles had the
        firepower to protect us from enemy patrols, but not from the infrequent
        shellfire that landed. General Collier then moved his Command Post and
        Headquarters to a two story red brick schoolhouse situated on the corner of a
        critical crossroads. The intersection was formed by Highway #B 221 (Roermonder
        Strasse) leading south to Aachen and #L 225 (Baesweiler Strasse) leading east to
        Baesweiler, Germany.<span style="font-weight:

        <font face="Arial">The mild temperatures of fall were near the season’s
            end as November had arrived. Now the rainfall increased daily making conditions
            in the field more miserable than usual. Mud added to the difficulties facing the
            men on foot, tank, trucks, jeeps and anything with wheels or tracks. The
            increasingly cold weather winds didn’t help matters either. The former German
            occupants of the homes in the area had fled east across the Roer River, vacating
            their homes that made them fair game for the GIs seeking shelter. &nbsp;<o:p>

        <font face="Arial">Before we had the opportunity to go house hunting, we
            were quartered in the schoolhouse with the rest of the personnel in CC“A”
            Headquarters. After the first few days of the mandatory requirement of “Stand
            By” 0530 hours at our vehicles with engines started and running, we got Lt.
            Moll’s OK allowing us to find our own accommodations without complying with
            the early morning wake up policy. Within one hundred yards, we found a perfect
            set-up; a former butcher shop with living quarters in the rear and bedrooms
            upstairs. We bootlegged a 110-volt power line, using field wire to tap into a 24
            hour running generator operated by our friends with the Command Radio half-track
            of S/Sgt. Tommy Spiers. This gave us a single light bulb after dark for our
            essentials - playing pinochle. The Cut Break tank crew became nightly visitors
            and card players. It was generally my luck, or lack thereof, to draw Virgil E.
            “Bazooka” Appleton, Cut Break’s tank driver, for my partner. Pinochle was
            just not his game. But he was entertaining with his Tupelo, Mississippi southern
            drawl and colorful speech containing expletives. Some of which we could not
            understand at times. Even Jones, our other redneck rebel couldn’t, but it was
            good for laughs.&nbsp;<o:p>

            that they lost two wiremen to a German night patrol while repairing lines to
            their Forward Observers, something that gave us concern.</span><span

        <font face="Arial">To make the 2 km run from CC“A” Hqs to Baesweiler,
            we had to drive past the Carolus Magnus coal mine, on the right side of
            Baesweiler road, with its towering slag pile and water tower; the latter was
            shot full of holes as a suspected observers point early on. Just beyond that
            point was the long red brick wall, also pock marked with shell holes from our
            tank fire. That whole stretch of road was under observation by the Germans who
            would send in a few rounds with any noticeable movement of two or more vehicles
            during daylight hours. They seldom fired at fast moving single vehicles. &nbsp;<o:p>

        <font face="Arial">In the beginning, the schoolhouse at the crossroads
            sporadically drew fire off and on, as the Krauts correctly assumed that we would
            utilize it in some capacity. After two weeks went by, the schoolhouse and corner
            intersection drew enemy shellfire at all hours of the day and night. Apparently,
            the Krauts knew it would support the use as a command post headquarters and they
            had the coordinates to zero in on it. Plus the nighttime aerial surveillance
            would show a fairly large concentration of vehicles parked around it. That was
            one more valid reason for the wire team’s move to other quarters. &nbsp;<o:p>

        <font face="Arial">While the rest of the wire team opted to sleep in the
            basement of the butcher shop, for obvious safety purposes, both Charlie Boss and
            I decided to sleep in the large upstairs “airy” front bedroom that contained
            two big beds. Each bed had a decent mattress and a real goose down comforter.
            One slight draw back was that the roof was missing some slate shingles here and
            there; these open “skylights” permitted us to gaze up at the British search
            lights, to the north, criss-crossing the skies to provide artificial moonlight.
            On one night, I lit a cigarette and looked across the room where I could see the
            red glow from Charlie’s cigarette, so I knew he too was awake. The sound and
            whistle of incoming shellfire roared over the top of our house, then the crashed
            as they hit near the corner -- causing Charlie to say, “Marsh, did you hear
            those incoming? Those bastards on the corner are catching hell tonight.” Then
            he made that cackling sound of his laughter, rolled over and went to sleep. With
            his gallows humor, the thought of Officers being punished was justified - or
            else it was better them than us!&nbsp;<o:p>

        <font face="Arial">In time, our units occupied Setterich, the site of the
            century old windmill, Loverich and Puffendorf. This meant more lines to run and
            repair when the line is knocked out by shellfire or torn up by the tank tracks.
            Repairs at night were the toughest. Broken phone wires “walking along the
            shoulder of the road in the pitch dark, seeing real and imagined corpses staring
            back at you; while all the time holding a piece of the broken wire running
            through your hand and being careful where you step is a real character builder.
            Up ahead, a hundred yards or more, your partner in the jeep has shut off the
            motor and is walking back towards you to find the break. The rain and the mud
            make it all more of a challenge, but later in the snow and cold it was even more
            difficult. Using wire cutters and making a splice means taking off the gloves
            that were inadequate in the first place, then touching that cold steel served to
            expedite repairs. Then test the line and hope there is an answer on the other
            end. Using the EE8A field telephone with the hand crank you’re able to turn
            the crank and if there is resistance, the line is working; if the crank spins
            free, there’s nothing on the other end. Meaning more than likely there is more
            than one break in the line and your night is not finished.&nbsp;<o:p>

            he was out checking on a radio relay crew. It was right after this incident that
            Moll noticed that his private stock of gin was disappearing and his cognac
            tasted weak. The culprit, Charlie Boss, had been taking swigs of the stuff
            daily. To cover it up he told Moll the gin evaporated once it was opened. By
            adding small amounts of water to replace the nips he took, he told Moll the

        <font face="Arial">On 16 November 1944, the attack called Operation Queen
            was launched which brought the front to the Roer River. After very heavy
            fighting and large tank battles, the Command seized and secured the line from
            Ederen, Freialdenhoven, Merzenhausen and Barmen by 28 November 1944. The enemy
            described this series of actions as being the greatest tank battle ever fought
            on any front. Division records later claim that the enemy lost 90 tanks in this
            battle, which lasted twelve days; 830 enemy were killed and 2,385 Germans
            captured, all from first line enemy tank and infantry divisions. The 2<sup>nd</sup>
            Armored Division losses were also considerable; our casualties were 203 killed,
            including Lt. Colonel Charles E. Etter, 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion, 41<sup>st</sup>
            Infantry Regiment, KIA 18 NOV 44, with 198 missing in action and 1,104 wounded.<span

            strong forces of German armor and infantry, supported by artillery and direct
            fire weapons, were beaten off with heavy loss to the enemy. The resistance was
            so fanatical that three days were required to clear and secure the little
            village of Merzenhausen against the largest types of enemy armor, dug-in
            infantry and direct fire weapons and against concentrations of enemy artillery
            and mortars. The Combat Command remained in a defensive position on the West

            Hull you ride with us.” I got my gear, checked my .45 and crawled in the back
            of the jeep, sitting on the spare and checked the 30 caliber machine gun mounted
            on a swivel base tripod welded to the floor between the two front seats. Our

            a hunch things weren’t looking right. We weren’t long in waiting. Jones
            slowed the jeep to a crawl, expecting any minute to be challenged by the guards
            on a roadblock asking for the password. Dead silence greeted us. All three of us
            knew there was something wrong - either Jones had taken the wrong turn leading
            into town or we missed a turn off. Jones gave it a try by calling out
            “Princess Pat” - the code name for the 3<sup>rd</sup> Battalion. After
            three more tries and no answer Jones decided to backtrack.&nbsp;<o:p>

            had Jones made the turn when we could hear the telltale mortar sounds of
            “crump, crump” landing in the village. Jones gunned the jeep and we were
            hauling ass. It was pitch black as I was staring straight ahead into the
            darkness when all of a sudden - BAM! The last sound I recall hearing was an
            explosion. Next thing I crashed against the machine gun and went over the top of
            Hull onto the hood of the jeep and down onto the road in the adjacent ditch. I

            plexus from the MG. It knocked the wind out of me, while my face and shoulder
            bounced off the canvas-covered hood. Jones was moaning in pain and Hull cut both

            the vehicles are too small to see at that on-coming speed until it is too late.
            But Jones made out like a burglar - a “Million dollar broken arm” and a
            ticket home to the USA, after stopping enroute in England to set his broken arm.

        <font face="Arial">A couple days later, a forty-eight hour pass to Paris
            opened up. I was the first of the lucky ones at CCA, along with a jeep
            messenger, by the name of Cleo Norris from Oil City, Louisiana to receive a
            pass. The long drive to Paris in GI trucks would require that we spend an
            overnight the first night on the road in St. Trond, France, reaching Paris the
            next day. We checked into the St. George Hotel and went out on the town (Pigalle).
            As for the rest of the city, the “joy” of Paris was a unique chance to
            consume inexpensive warm wine and be mesmerized by the ambrosia resulting from
            unkempt armpits. &nbsp;<o:p>

        <font face="Arial"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>In the
            hours quickly winding down, I was fortunate to meet a young very attractive WAC
            who was stationed in Paris with SHAEF Headquarters. I met her in a caf” where
            Americans hung out. I was at a table next to hers. I hadn’t been able to take
            my eyes off of her and was spell bound just looking at her and listening to her
            talk to her WAC companions. Whether her friends tipped her off or when she
            glanced over at me looking at her, she brazenly asked, “Well, what are you
            staring at?” I grinned and with a shrug frankly told her I was captivated by
            her stunning good looks and the sound of her voice. Honesty is the best policy
            of genuine sincerity. After groans from her WAC friends about “what a line”
            she was all smiles with my flattery. I followed with, “I’m just a lonely
            soldier” that brought more guffaws and laughter. After more banter I seriously
            asked her, “Can we get acquainted?” She accepted my offer to sit at my
            table. We hit it off and spent most of the night asking and answering each
            others questions. I thoroughly enjoyed just being able to converse with her. You
            never realize just how important it is until you’ve been deprived of the
            sensual sounds of the American female voice for more than a year. As she had a
            midnight bed check, I walked her to her WAC-hotel quarters. The experience made
            the trip more than worthwhile -- with a fond memory of her and Paris.&nbsp;<o:p>

            were strict with the rear echelon personnel who were required to wear neckties
            and caps - we wore neither and were not bothered; combat units were excluded
            as they noted our triangle 2AD shoulder patch. While the MPs would not harass us
            for lack of uniform requirements (caps &amp; neckties) they always checked your
            pass expiration date. On the last day, they rounded up many of us and “escorted” us to the collection
            point - Place de Concorde. We bid Paris
            adieu. There we were loaded back on trucks, making the overnight stop once again
            at St. Trond, before arriving back in Germany. Back to war.&nbsp;<o:p>

        <font face="Arial">On 3 December 1944, the Headquarters for CC“A”
            moved into the city of Baesweiler. The wire team occupied a small house in the
            center of town about a block away from the HQS. Among the many citizens of
            Holland who volunteered their services to assist us, one stands out above the
            rest - Colonel Adrian Paulen, or “Dutch” as we referred to him. He served
            with us from 16 September 1944 to 18 January 1945. Dutch was our liaison officer
            and had been a member of the Heerlen Dutch underground resisting the German
            occupation. Very fluent in the English and German languages and very dedicated.
            He was well liked by the staff of CCA, especially General Collier.&nbsp;<o:p>

        <font face="Arial">Rather than requesting a Sergeant from the Signal
            Company, Moll called on an old friend from the past at Tidworth Barracks,
            England. He sent for the former Master Sergeant Charles Tichacek, from Garfield,
            New Jersey, who had been the ranking man in the Signal Company, until Captain
            Henry J. Stuart, busted him to Private and kicked him out of the Company.
            Tichacek wound up in the 66<sup>th</sup> Armored Regiment Maintenance Battalion.
            Now a Staff Sergeant, he arrived at CC“A” to take over as the Com Sarge in
            the Headquarters under Moll. Charlie chose to stick close to the wire team and
            we developed into life long friends for more than 50 years. Charlie, being a
            full blooded Czechoslovakian, naturally I called him “Pollock.” He in turn
            called me “Irish.”&nbsp;<o:p>
