        <&nbsp;By Don R. Marsh </p>
            <p>The brutal bone-chilling cold was not our ally -- nor
                theirs. At times we struggled through waist-deep snow or slid off the ice slick
                roads. Normal winter weather for the Ardennes Mountains of Belgium in January
                1945.
            </p>
            <p>The New Year 1945 greeted us with the most adverse weather
                conditions to dislodge the entrenched German salient. They were very tough
                opponents with desperate leaders, but with a flawed plan to reach the Belgium
                coast with their last Blitzkrieg. However, we stopped them cold - ice cold; but
                not without paying the price in both manpower and equipment. Their losses were
                greater than ours as it turned out.
            </p>
            <p>The Twelfth Army's plan under General Bradley was to drive
                south and southeast to join up with General Patton's Third Army pushing up from
                the south. The junction city was Houffalize and our target point to close the
                gap of the Bulge. Bradley directed General &quot;Lightning Joe&quot; Collins'
                VII Corps, the best and the most experienced of his arsenal, consisting of the
                2nd (Hell On Wheels) and the 3rd (Spearhead) Armored Divisions to lead the
                counter attack. These two heavy weight armored divisions were led by two of the
                most able and experienced veteran division commanders, Major General Ernest
                (Profane Ernie) Harmon and Major General Maurice Rose. Attacking abreast, we
                began the coordinated assault along with the 83rd and 84th Infantry Divisions,
                assigned to cover our flanks and mop-up resistance in the by-passed woods.
            </p>
            <p>My unit, with Task Force O&quot;Farrell (LTC Hugh
                O'Farrell, 3rd Bn, 66th AR) a part of Combat Command &quot;A&quot; crossed the
                MLR (Main Line of Resistance) in a blinding snow storm with limited visibility
                on January 3rd. Our initial objectives were two small villages of Trinal and
                Magoster. Very heavy fighting developed in the deep snow drifts, extreme cold
                and the wooded mountains with the enemy in their dug-in defensive positions. Our
                column had reached the high ground of a plateau where our tanks fanned out
                preparing to launch a follow-up attack after halting long enough for our
                artillery to work over several troublesome spots located by our FOs (Forward
                Observers) on the ground. Our air support left much to be desired due to the
                poor flying conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this pause I sat behind the wheel of my vehicle
                waiting, as was everyone else, for the word to &quot;move out.&quot; In all
                probability at the time, I must have been reliving moments from my recent 48
                hours pass to Paris the previous month and wishing I was still there, when I saw
                a jeep heading over my way. The driver stopped close to my left side and his
                lone passenger approached on foot. Moments before I had stood up on my seat to
                get a better view of where the rounds were landing from our guns. I guess this
                is when he noticed me there. He appeared to be old enough to be a field grade
                officer and wore a new type of a green parka with a hood and a fur lined collar
                that was attached. This was one I had never seen before. Definitely officer
                material. Ordinary GIs didn't get fur lined collars, not in those days unless
                you were a flyboy. I couldn't see his rank. He asked, &quot;What's your name
                soldier?&quot; My answer, &quot;My name is Don R. Marsh, Sir.&quot; Him,
                &quot;What's your rank?&quot; Me, &quot;I'm a Private (here we go again, O'
                well, easy come easy go), Sir.&quot; Him, &quot;&quot;Where's your
                hometown&quot;&quot; Me, &quot;Racine, Wisconsin, Sir.&quot; Him, &quot;What is
                it you are wearing?&quot; Me, &quot;(O' shit) A German motorcycle rider's two
                piece rain suit, Sir&quot; Him, &quot;Where did you get it?&quot; Me, &quot;From
                a German who didn't need it anymore, Sir.&quot; Him, &quot;You don't have to
                'sir' me, soldier. I am an Associated Press correspondent. My name is Wes
                Gallagher.&quot; Me, &quot;Thank you, Sir.&quot; Him, &quot;Good luck
                soldier.&quot; Me, &quot;Thank you, Sir.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>By January 15th, after continuous heavy fighting, Beffe
                Devanave, Dochamps, Samree (Colonel C. J. Mansfield, CO 66th Armored Regiment,
                was Killed In Action taking Samree), Wibrin and Achouffe had fallen along with
                many other small towns and villages in between. Then on January 16th, Combat
                Command &quot;A&quot; had taken the high ground overlooking Houffalize and at
                0640 hours made contact with the 11th Armored Division of the 3rd Army. We had
                closed the door at last. Within a few weeks, I received a letter from my folks
                containing a front page newspaper article that had appeared in the Chicago Daily
                Tribune News, dated January 5, 1945. The by line was from Erezee, Belgium, dated
                January 4th and written by Wes Gallagher. It reads:

            <h2 class="center"><b>BATTLEGROUND A 'WHITE HELL' TO DOUGHBOYS&nbsp;</b></h2>
            <p class="center"><b><i>By Wes Gallagher&nbsp;</i></b></p>
            <p><i><b>Plowing head-on into the German army's most powerful battle positions,
                        American troops of the First Army have smashed their way forward in the last two
                        days in the most appalling conditions ever seen on the western front. Every inch
                        of ground being won by these doughboys on Field Marshall Von Rundstedt's
                        northern flank is being won by sheer guts and not on grand strategy. The
                        doughboys and tanks advanced through a snow and sleet storm which turned the
                        fighting in these mountains to a white hell. The Germans are making each town
                        and hill a strong point and exact the maximum price for the capture before
                        falling back. The price to Americans at times has been high - quite high.</b></i></p>
            <h3 class="center"><i><b>Churned Alleys of Ice</b></i></h3>
            <p><i><b>All over the mountains and woods wet snow was falling. The roads were
                        churned alleys of ice, snow and mud. Trucks, tank sand guns slide round like
                        giraffes on roller skates. This division moved secretly in a night march to hit
                        the Germans. It was one of the wildest marches in history. Thirty ton tanks went
                        spinning down icy hills in circles, snapping telephone poles like blades of
                        grass. Big guns slithered off the roads into gulleys. The slightest hill made
                        the steel tracks of tanks churn helplessly. The division reached the jump-off
                        point just in time to eat a cold breakfast and start moving again. It has been
                        like that since the offensive started, only now the Germans are adding their own
                        hazards to the weather in the shape of artillery barrages and mortar fire.
                        &quot;The Germans are using more artillery than we have seen before, &quot;said
                        LTC R.W. Jenna, &quot;We can't get a Piper Cub off the ground and there is no
                        chance of counter-battery fire. Our troops just have to take it.&quot; He added,
                        &quot;This snow and sleet does some queer things. Some of our GIs at first
                        claimed the Germans were using some sort of new silent gun, but it was just
                        these freak battle conditions that deadens the sound.&quot;</b></i></p>
            <p><i><b>The German policy has been to hold some strategic
                        ground and then hide anti-tank guns in the woods around a town, protecting its
                        approaches and put up a furious battle for it. The anti-tank guys can't be seen
                        by the tankers because of heavy snowfall, but the German gunners can see the
                        tanks moving and cut loose, knocking them out. Once pushed out of town, the
                        Germans plaster it with heavy artillery. An attack in one sector halted simply
                        because our tanks could not get up an icy hill, although not a shot was fired.
                        Doughboys are protecting the tanks after dark by digging shallow foxholes and
                        sitting shivering in them throughout the night.&quot; There is nothing else the
                        men can do except just take it and sleep in the snow, &quot;said an officer.</b></i></p>
            <p><i><b>The only man not concerned with the weather on this
                        front today was Pvt. Don R. Marsh of Racine, Wisconsin, a member of a wire crew.
                        He had on a captured German rubber rain suit running around happily in the slush
                        while the rest of his soaked companions looked on enviously.&quot; End of news

            <p>No, I was not happy nor running around, but if Wes Gallagher thought so, who am I to argue?</p>
