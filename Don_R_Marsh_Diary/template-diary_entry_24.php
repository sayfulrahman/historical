    <font face="Arial">MY STORY BEHIND THE BIOGRAPHY OF GENERAL ROSE</font>
</h1>
<p align="center"><i><b>
            <font face="Arial">By Don R. Marsh</font>
        </b></i></p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was early October of 1995 when I received Issue #2 of
        the 2nd Armored Division Association Bulletin. While briefly scanning for names
        of fellow veteran friends of mine, there it was on the top of page 6. Something
        immediately drew my attention to it, with the headline, &quot;Can you, will you
        help?&quot; It was from a letter written by a Steven L. Ossad -- a person
        unknown to me. I had never read his name until then, as he was not a member of
        our Association. Reading further, I learned that he was not only a non-member,
        but neither was he a veteran. I assumed it was some family member seeking
        information on a relative/family member lost in battle, which is common in
        veterans' news periodicals. But no, he was asking for help in finding
        information on the death of Major General Maurice Rose, a non-relative. When he
        incorrectly stated that Rose's death was 31 March 1945, I read that and thought
        this guy really needs my help! He had the story partially correct when he wrote
        that Rose was an &quot;up from the ranks, a non West Point, Jewish
        officer.&quot; So I assumed that meant that he had done some previous homework -
        little did I know at that time that he had acquired far more data about the Rose
        family history than I knew! It was Rose's military data he was seeking. I would
        learn all this later.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve Ossad had written in his request for information,
        &quot;I would be appreciative of any help you can offer.&quot; So being the
        &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; that I am and willing to offer whatever support I
        could give, I replied by letter on October 10, 1995, (ironically October 10th is
        also the birthday of General Rose's jeep driver, on that fateful night, 30 March
        1945, my friend, Glenn H. Shaunce). I mentioned that I had served under General
        Rose's Headquarters Combat Command &quot;A&quot; of the Second Armored Division
        in the Invasion of Normandy, France, June 1944 and the Breakout at St. Lo, in
        Operation Cobra, July 1944.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve recognized my name from an article previously
        published in the Army's Armor Magazine, March-April 1991,The Triumph and Tragedy
        of Major General Maurice Rose, written by Ralph C. Greene, MD. I had exchanged
        correspondence with Dr. Greene regarding Rose's Combat Command &quot;A&quot; at
        the Invasion Beachhead at Carentan, France, on 13 June 1944. Steve immediately
        replied and pressed me for details based on the information published.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a cautious slow start, he was still a stranger to
        me, the flow of letters and telephone calls rapidly became a daily occurrence
        and in time they soon led to our sending emails and computerized copies of
        documents. We were two amateur historians with the same goal - willing to
        exchange information about the life of Maurice Rose, both personal and military.
        We made visits to each other's homes and then formed a bond of friendship by
        means of an open exchange of information and our theories (at that time, ours
        remained to be proven). In a literary seminal moment, we agreed to coauthor a
        manuscript about the untimely death of the relatively unknown American Army
        General, Maurice Rose. Our arrangement was simple - Steve would handle the
        keyboard and enter everything into his computer. Not owning a computer at the
        time, as a journalist investigator, I would assist in the research, and include
        my own wartime memoirs. Soon I was forced to give up my typewriter and buy a
        complete computer set-up. This enabled me to send emails and letters to contacts
        in the USA, Belgium, Holland and most importantly, made it possible to locate
        and interview German veterans, including the German Panzer men from the unit
        that ambushed General Rose &quot;that night.&quot;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Destiny stepped in to arrange this juxtaposition; in
        effect we were two complete strangers who might be rightly described as total
        &quot;opposites.&quot; He is a younger man in his mid-fifties; today, I am 80
        years old. He has not served a single day in the military and I am a retired
        Technical Sergeant, veteran of World War Two, having served 20 years of active
        duty, plus 10 more years in the reserves. He has earned three degrees, including
        an MBA from Harvard -- whereas I finished high school and enlisted as a
        volunteer in the army. He is of the Jewish faith and I am a secular humanist. We
        live in opposite ends of the state - he lives in San Francisco and I reside in
        southern California. To date, in the nearly seven years that have transpired, we
        have met but three times. Communication was not a problem, as I became a part of
        his extended family and he a part of mine. We have one great thing in common
        however, a strong mutual desire to tell this story of a true military legend we
        both admired, Major General Maurice Rose.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the inception, obtaining the full story has taken
        years of time to materialize due to the seemingly impossible and difficult
        challenge of penetrating the layers of military bureaucracy, solely by
        correspondence through &quot;proper channels&quot;, to secure the vital records
        and documents buried deep in the army archives for more than fifty years. I knew
        from past personal military experience, while serving with the IG (Inspector
        General), the typed Field Reports made by teams of investigators assigned to the
        case after interviewing any and all witnesses to determine the cause of General
        Rose's death were recorded and had to be still on file. These Field Reports
        would not have been destroyed. A photocopy or microfiche film had to be stored
        on file in the archives -- someplace. The Army repeatedly declined to help in
        finding the location of the missing crucial files. Without the conclusive proof
        in these two files, one domestic and the other ETO (European Theater of
        Operations), we didn't have a case or an authoritative story with credentials.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, with our persistence and the assistance of two of
        our most powerful California representatives, Christopher Cox and Dianne
        Feinstein, we were able to pry loose the once classified essential critical
        files to thoroughly review the investigation reports. More importantly, we were
        able to research the affidavits taken from on-the-scene witnesses by Army Field
        IG investigators. What we learned from those two files (US &amp; ETO) was
        dynamite! This enabled us to meticulously piece together the sequences and
        events that led to Rose's death on the night of 30 March 1945 at Hamborn,
        Germany. From the facts in the files available to us, we were able to make a
        positive confirmation whether or not it appeared to be murder of a Prisoner of
        War or an &quot;unfortunate accident in the heat of battle.&quot; Friends fluent
        in German painstakingly translated a search of the German army records (that I
        received from a German veteran) of the Panzer tank unit involved in the ambush.
        Not surprisingly it had a different perspective from statements made by US
        witnesses. Then we began the arduous task of assembling a multitude of documents
        and file copies of records from various American and German civilian and
        military historian sources, including Rose family members, of the man's 45-year
        life span from his birth in Middletown, Connecticut on 26 November 1899 to his
        untimely death. We described the painful Rose family details of the days
        following the shooting, including his burial at the US Military Cemetery at
        Margraten in The Netherlands, then the aftermath and tragic family
        disintegration that followed.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, the manuscript was crafted in a scholarly
        fashion and submitted to selected military book publishers to no avail. Editors
        would read the synopsis and write back, &quot;Although well written, the story
        is about an unknown general.&quot; Unknown perhaps to the civilians without
        military backgrounds, but not to the veterans who fought in the bloody campaigns
        across Western Europe! The fact that we were also two unknown authors was not
        mentioned nor over-looked. As the frustration factor began to build, we were
        fortunate to obtain the services of a well-known, long established literary
        agency, Blanche C. Gregory Inc., to represent us. Our agent, Merry K. Pantano,
        after more than two dozen rejections by various publishers finally placed the
        work with Cooper Square Press who will publish our book titled, <b><i>&quot;Major
                General Maurice Rose: World War II's Greatest Forgotten Commander&quot;</i></b>
        in the spring of 2003.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subject of creating a title for our work presented
        another problem. Steve first suggested using &quot;The Extinguished Flame of MG
        Maurice Rose&quot;; whereas I thought a title with a punch would be better and
        suggested using &quot;In The Heat of Battle: The Murder of The Commanding
        General.&quot; Our mentor, Martin Blumenson sent us his suggestion, &quot;From
        Rabbi's Son To a Military Legend: Major General Maurice Rose.&quot; But, once we
        sold the publishing rights to Cooper Square Press, they settled that with their
        revised choice of the title. In the end, after the book is finally available to
        the public, Maurice Rose will no longer be the Forgotten Commander.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to meeting and exchanging correspondence with
        so many interesting people from all walks of life and from all parts of the
        world while doing research for this manuscript, I received a deep sense of
        gratification from two key experiences. One from the human-interest standpoint
        was finding and uniting General Rose's two sons (half-brothers) from the
        general's two marriages. These two men, now 76 and 61 years of age, had never
        met nor spoken to each other in their lifetimes until our research connected
        them and made it possible.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other experience has been the pleasure of watching my
        young friend, partner and coauthor, Steven L. Ossad, launch his professional
        career as a military historian and successful author with this biography of
        Major General Maurice Rose, knowing this will undoubtedly serve as the linchpin
        of his future in writing military history.</font>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <font face="Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Along the way through this long journey of
        life, now in my twilight years, I give thanks that I made a great friend and
        close confidant for life, Steven L. Ossad - without whom, this story could not
        have been possibly told.</font>
