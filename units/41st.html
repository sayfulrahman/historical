Infantry Regiment<strong> and 42nd Armored Infantry Battalion</strong></font></h1>
<p><font face="Verdana">The 41st was constituted as 41st Infantry Regiment 15 May
1917, and organized at Ft. Snelling, Minnesota, from the personnel of the 36th
Infantry Regiment. The regiment was inactivated at Camp Meade, Maryland, 22
Sept.1921. It was reactivated and assigned to the 2nd Armored Division at Ft.
Benning, Georgia, 15 July 1940. and redesignated 41st Armored Infantry Regiment,
8 January 1942. The 41st participated in the assault on Sicily, landing at
Licata, Sicily and engaged in the battle for Canicati, Sicily.
Vire-Mortain-Domfront Operations-France--From the breakout sector, the entire
2nd Armored Division joined in the operation to reduce the enemy’s threat in
the vicinity of Mortain, Vire, Flers, Domfront. Throughout the first half of
August, 1944, the Division held its ground on the north and south flanks of the
German thrust and by steady pressure drove the enemy back, aiding materially in
the eventual closing the Falaise gap. Co. H., 41st Armored Infantry Regiment
held a hill east of Mortain for five rugged days and nights, driving back
repeated enemy counterattacks. Co. H, 41st Inf. also received the Presidential
Citation for its valiant stand in this engagement. CC&quot;A&quot; pushed from
the Vire area toward Flers and rejoined the Division in the Domfont area. The
41st also was cited in the drive to break the Siegfried line east of the Roer
river. Lt. Col. Etter, the commander and Major Berra Battalion Executive were
killed in this period of time, when the Battalion was under artillery and mortar
fire.The Battalion also was in the Battle of the Bulge, and in heavy combat near
Samree, Belgium. The Battalion took part in the Rhine crossing and the advance
into and the capture of <strong>Magdeburg on the Elbe River.</strong> Awards:

<h3><strong><font face="Verdana">The Elbe Crossing</font></strong></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana">From the perspective of the infantryman involved the Elbe
river crossing was an operation that started in confusion and ended in
confusion. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong. I was in the 41st
Armored Infantry, 3rd Bn.&quot;G&quot; company, 3rd platoon. We had left
Liebenberg, Germany on the morning of 11 April 1945 and literally barreled 60
miles through the German lines to the Elbe river on the outskirts of Schoenbeck.
The next morning we were clearing out resistance there when the company was
abruptly withdrawn to Bad Salzemen. The word was we were stopping at the Elbe
and the Russians would be allowed to take Berlin, However late that afternoon
the battalion was alerted for an assault on the east bank. Many of the GIs who
were out celebrating what was thought to be the end of the war for us, were not
aware of the alert and we had to search the town for them.. The battalion
assembled at Westerhousen where we just sat and waited and waited. Finally our
artillery began firing and after an hour long barrage the 1st Bn. crossed in
assault boats and our Bn. followed. No provision was made to get armor or
supplies across with us.The bridgehead itself was made with practically no
contact with enemy except that we did exchange some friendly fire with a patrol
of the 1st Bn. during the early morning. The 119th Inf. Regiment, 3rd Bn.( 30th
Inf.) later followed us across.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">A pontoon bridge was started by the 17th Armored Engineer
Bn. in the early morning to get our tanks and supplies across. Meantime we were
expanding the bridgehead. However German artillery was destroying the pontoon
bridge as soon as progress was made in constructing it. Our Bn. reached the town
of RANDAU then had to fall back because the 1st Bn had been attacked by tanks
and infantry and not having armor for support, had to pull back. That night at
about 21:00 hours ( this was the 13th ) we had to abandon the bridgehead since
the bridge couldn't be completed, and it became obvious armor and supplies could
not be ferried across the river to support us, and our position had become
vulnerable. We were ordered to move south to the Grunewald and Elbenau area
where the 119th. Inf. was operating. At this point we had been in constant
operation since the 11th. We all were exhausted and some men so bad off that
when we stopped for a break it took pleading to get them moving again. As we
neared Elbenau before dawn we saw that part of the town was ablaze and we had
troops trapped there. It turned out later these were elements the 119th Inf.we
were supposed to link up with. Our company was on the south edge of the town.
Just as dawn broke we were attacked and overrun from several directions by tanks
and supported by infantry They stopped just out side the effective range of the
bazooka and fired at us. Our artillery from across the river helped keep the
tanks off us for a while. Soon 7 or 8 of our squad found ourselves cut off from
the company. We could see that other members of our battalion were also trapped
and saw one shot down while surrendering. We took cover in a long fire trench
with woods at our back and the river beyond the woods but rifle fire was useless
at this point. A tank and an SP turned in our direction. The tank broke off to
the right but the the SP came in laying down machine gun fire but then stopped.
The hatch opened, a head popped out yelling something like ôcommen zie roust
you sobs. Our bazooka man, Mike....don't remember his last name asked if anyone
wanted to surrender. No one did ( or would admit to it ) and he turned and
yelled go bleep bleep kraut and fired a bazooka round and missed, then it seemed
that all hell broke loose. The SP fired a round that went over our heads we felt
the heat from it. Someone said lets get out of here and go for the river. We
scrambled out, Bud Andrews and I were together made it to the woods, how Ill
never know. They continued firing into the woods but none of the German
infantrymen followed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Once we got to the river the question was how to get
across, the current looked awful swift. This was in the afternoon of the 14th
and we didn't know that some of our battalion and the 119th had made it back
into the 1st Bn. perimeter and were to be evacuated by DUKWS upriver, or we
would have tried to get there. We were at an unused boat dock and having no
apparent options we decided to swim across.We took off our combat trousers,
boots an cartridge belts and dropped our rifles into the river and started. I
was an excellent swimmer but I didn't realize how weakened I was from exhaustion
and lack of sleep and food. I had to fight the desire to just give up and drown.
When I reached the river bank far downstream from where I started, I just lay in
the mud in shock or utter exhaustion,probably both and just wanted to go to
sleep. After a while I was able to crawl and stagger to a nearby house . Just as
I got there a woman came out with a basket of wash. With look of fright on her
face she dropped the basket turned an scooted in the house. Her husband came out
and hesitantly motioned me to come, and then helped me in to the house. At this
point I had no voice. They said something in German, she left and came back with
a glass of schnapps, which I gulped down and promptly went out like a light. I
awoke to find myself on a cot in the early morning of the 16th. That morning the
husband took his bike and went to an American unit occupying the town to get
help for me. I had the idea he was not very comfortable about harboring a GI. A
jeep picked me up and took me to a medical unit where I was examined and
released and re-booted, then taken to the Div. HQ. where I was interviewed, then
back to my company, where I was told I was just reported MIA, then back to Div.
HQ to get my name off the MIA list. My buddy Walt Andrews was there to greet me,
he had been picked up by a civilian in a boat. He was surprised when I showed up
because they had searched for me then gave up thinking I had drowned. This
operation was the end of combat for our battalion. It was pretty well chopped
up. Our company alone had about 60 MIAs</font></p>
