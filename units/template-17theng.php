<p><font face="Verdana">At Ciney, Belgium, ( Ardennes Offensive ) Gen. Collier was
in command of CC &quot;A&quot; was ordered by Gen. Harmon to hold Ciney, in this
force was 2nd Bn., 41st Armored Inf., 2nd Bn. 66th Armor, and a platoon each
from &quot;A&quot; Co. 17th Engineers, and &quot;A&quot; Co. 702d Tank Destroyer
Bn.. On November 26, 1944 along with other elements of CC &quot;A&quot;, Co.
&quot;A&quot; 17th Armored Engineers was ordered to secure Merzenhausen and
Barmen to cut off communication lines to the Roer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">August 1944: Seine River Crossing: After pushing a
bridgehead force across, Company &quot;A&quot;, 17th Engineer Bn., built a
thirty-foot treadway bridge. Gen. Collier ordered them across before nightfall.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">17th Engineers: A Narrative Report of Company
&quot;D&quot;, for early August 1944, It goes like this : In assembly area at
Notre Dame De Cenilly. 2 August 44: Moved to Percy, 3 August 44: Moved one mile
west of Montbray. 4 August 44: Moved from Montbray to one mile south of Montbray
where enemy was contacted and company with reconnaissance elements ( 82nd
Reconnaissance ) were forced to withdraw. 5 August 44: Moved to one and one-half
miles east of St. Sever De Calvados. Removed twenty # 2 and # 4 Teller mines
from the roads and booby traps from the hedgerows. 6 August 44: Moved three
miles west of St. Sever De Calvados. 7 August 44: Moved to two miles west of
LeTeilleul. 8 August 44: Moved to two miles southeast of Lonlay L�Abbaye and
at 2300 blew bridge in center of town after having entered earlier in the
afternoon and then withdrawing. Also blew up enemy ammunition dump at this town
and destroyed four enemy vehicles. All this was done in conjunction with a
platoon of the 82nd Recon. Bn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Hedgerow penetration: The 17th Engineers used a tank with
a bulldozer blade to go through hedgerows in France. But then the Germans would
wait until the tanks would cross with infantry following on foot then fire on
them. In order to counter this, the American forces started through the
hedgerows with their main guns loaded with canister and pointed to the rear and
to the flanks. As the tanks crashed through the opening , they fired parallel to
the hedges, inflicting great casualties. For this the 2nd Armored was given the
name of &quot;Roosevelt's Butchers,&quot; a name which the division gladly
accepted.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">17th Engineers: Prior to the 2nd Armored Division entry
into the Rhine-Elbe offensive and the drive across the Westphalian plain of
Germany through Bruswick and Saxony to the Elbe River. Co.E, 17th Engineer
Battalion, ( the division�s organic bridge company ) broke all records in
bridge construction by completing an 1152-foot treadway bridge across the Rhine
in approximately nine hours.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Dear Mr. Swonger,&nbsp; I found on your 2nd Armd Div website also information
about 17th Engineers (see unit list of 2d AD) on 8th April 45 west of Marsum
(which is properly Harsum north of the town of Hildesheim). I am looking for any
information about the pontoon bridge which was&nbsp;constructed by elements of
17th Engineers to cross the Hildesheim Branch Canal (s. attached files) near
Harsum. You call it the Weser Elbe Kanal (in II. WW) what is now the so-called
Mittellandkanal with branches leading to Hildesheim and Salzgitter.To get any
assistance by your association would be very useful (after action reports - 5th
- 8th (9th) April). I am LTC (German Army) and at present with the German Army
Office at Cologne. In 1984 when British Forces&nbsp;set up&nbsp;the Exercise
Spearpoint / Lionheart&nbsp;84 I&nbsp;met also elements of Hell on Wheels east
of Hildesheim. We made contact for to counterattack the British when heading to
the east. You know - the old scenario - before reunification in 1990. I saw them
the first time riding the pretty new Abrams tanks. We were on Leopard, also the
Dutch and the British on Challenger and Chieftain tanks. It was fantastic to see
elements of 2d AD on their way to attack which was extremely perfect to stop the
British. And it was in the same area which 2d AD penetrated in April 45. But
first of all I would like to confirm the crossing site near Harsum and to get
more information (in detail) by reports of 17th Engineers on the certain days.
Hope you&nbsp;could help in finding some information.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">24 March 1945: Co. &quot;A&quot; 17th Engr. Bn., attached
to XVI Corps, constructed a bridge across the Rhine River south of Wesel,
Germany. Co. &quot;A&quot; with Co. &quot;C&quot; 202nd Engineer Combat team
attached an 1153 foot M-2 treadway Bridge in support of the XVI Corps assault
crossing. The bridge site was four miles south of Wesel, Germany, was secured by
the 30th Inf. Div. The assembly of the bridge took place in a woods near Camp
Renuck, here bridge floats were prefabricated, it took 25 -2 1/2 tons trucks to
transport this unassembled bridge to the site. No direct fire was received on
the bridge site while under construction, but artillery was a problem from the
Germans. Five days later the whole division unleashed its striking power of
tanks, armored artillery and armored infantry to force crossings over the
Dortmund-Ems Canal, as well as the Weser, Leine, Innerste, Oker and Elbe Rivers.
Useful information from Germany.&nbsp; 4/82001</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">On 30 March 1945 a patrol from Co. &quot;D&quot;, 17th
Engr. Bn. attempted to investigate and cross the bridge across the Dortmund-ems
canal at Oleen, in the face of small arms fire. The bridge was blown up by the
enemy before it could complete it's reconnaissance. On the same day , Co.
&quot;A&quot; 17th Armd. Eng. in support of Co. &quot;C&quot;, constructed a
treadway bridge across the canal near Alvert.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">On the 5 April 1945, the 17th Engr. Bn. constructed a 384
treadway across the Weser at Ohr, Germany, permitting CC &quot;A&quot; to cross
the river with armor and continue with it's operation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">On 8 April 1945 division engineers constructed a pontoon
bridge across the Weser Elbe Canal, west of,Harsum allowing CC&quot;A&quot; to
continue it's drive northeast to Braunschweig.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">More later about the crossing at the Elbe river near
Madgeburg, Germany and the very important part that the 17th Eng. Bn played in
this operation.</font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
