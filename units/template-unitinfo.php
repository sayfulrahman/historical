    <p>
        <font face="Verdana">The 14th Armored Field Artillery Battalion was originally
            organized 23 May 1917 at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma as the 14th Field Artillery
            Regiment. The regiment was inactivated 1 September 1921, though elements of the
            regiment were activated for brief periods of existence between 1922 and 1936.
            The insignia of the 14th was taken from the shield of the Satan, Kiowa Indian
            chief. The insignia carries the motto &quot;EX HOC SIGNO VICTORIA&quot;--WITH
            THIS SIGN VICTORY. First Commander was Col. R. P. Shugg. On 15 July 1940 at Fort
            Benning, Georgia, the regiment was redesignated as an Armored Field Artillery
            regiment and was activated as a unit of the 2nd Armored Division, Regular Army.
            Reorganization and redesignation of the regiment as and Armored Field Artillery
            Battalion resulted 1 January 1942 from reorganization of the Armored Division
            structure at the time.</font>

    <p>
        <font face="Verdana">After a period of training in the United States the 14th
            Armored Field Artillery Battalion as a unit of the 2nd Armored Division,
            departed the Zone of Interior for Africa, where Battery B won battle honors,
            including credit for an assault landing, in Algeria-French Morocco campaign, the
            battalion underwent additional training before participating in the Sicilian
            campaign, with the entire battalion winning assault landing credit in this
            campaign. After the <strong>Sicilian</strong> campaign ended, the battalion
            restaged in England before landing on the continent of Europe 10 July 1944. Ten
            months of combat followed during which period the battalion took part in five
            major campaigns, Normandy, Northern France, ( some of this action described
            below) Ardennes-Alsace, Rhineland, and Central Europe, won the Distinguished
            Unit Citation for action in Normandy campaign and was twice cited by the Belgian
            government and awarded the Belgian Fourragere in the colors of the Croix de
            Guerre.</font>

        <font face="Verdana">Historical account of the <strong>14th FA in Normandy.
                Operation &quot;Cobra&quot;</strong> began at 1100B hours <strong>25 July 1944</strong>.
            The 14th FA had moved to a position just north of Villebaudon, Fr. to support
            the anticipated attack on Percy, Fr. Soon on the arrival to the new position the
            battalion was firing both North and South at the same time. The batteries fired
            south in support of the attack, while the other battery fired north, using
            Charge 1, at three enemy tanks at the la Denisiere crossroad which the battalion
            had just passed. The enemy kept control of this crossroad. Some supplies were
            able to come through the crossroads by using a diversion tactic. On 30 July 1944
            the 14th was ordered to move with an attack toward Percy, they formed a column,
            and while they were in this position the Germans counterattacked, the battalion
            immediately went into a firing position and was firing point blank to keep from
            getting overrun by the Germans. All available manpower was used, including
            cooks, clerks, using small arms to beat back the attack and to keep from being
            overrun, the artillery was firing direct at about 2000 yds. both east and west
            at the enemy. And then:&nbsp;</font>

    <p>
        <font face="Verdana">At the end of 1974 the army announced that it was
            going to deploy a brigade TDY to Germany for 6 months at a time. It would be
            called Brigade 75 because it would not start to deploy until then. The 2AD was
            designated as the unit to deploy forces. One of the first things announced was
            the initial deploying units and that a new brigade would be activated to
            replaced the units deploying. The units of the St Lo brigade were the first to
            go. This was 2-66 AR, 1-41 IN, 1-50 IN, and 1-14 FA. They deployed to Grafenwher,
            Hoenfels, and Wilflicken(sic). 2-66 AR and 1-14 FA were at Graf with the brigade
            headquarters and the 498th Spt Bn. 1-41 IN at Hoenhfels and 1-50 IN at
            &quot;Wild Chicken&quot;. We drew all of the equipment from POMCUS stocks and
            deployed to our homes away from home.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font face="Verdana">So as you can tell for a period of time the 2AD
            had four maneuver brigades assigned to it. At one point the 2AD unit up north
            was replaced in the rotation by a 1CAV infantry unit. This
            six month rotation went on until 1978 when it was announced that the 2AD Forward
            would be relocated to Garlstadt in northern Germany. 1-14 FA was one of the
            units stationed there until the brigade was brought home to the US. Patrick

        <font face="Verdana">The 78th Armored Field Artillery was joined and
            formed into the 2nd Armored Division on 15 July 1940, and the first commander
            was Lt. Col. Thomas Handy. More later here.</font>

        <font face="Verdana"><strong>Action of the 78th Armored Field Artillery
                Battalion on 29 July 1944: </strong>On the morning of 29 July 1944 the 78th
            Armored Field Artillery Battalion, was in position southwest of Notre-Dame de
            Cenilly at the important crossroad. The 1st Battalion, 67th AR Regiment had its
            CP (Command Post) about five hundred yards to the rear of the 78th but there
            were no tanks supporting or with the 78th.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font face="Verdana">A small force of the 1st Bn., 67th AR with 1st Lt. Richard
            C. Moses, a 78th F.O., had progressed about 10,000 yards west but was now cut
            off. Another small force, the 2nd Bn., 76th AR , under Lt. Col. Wynne, was about
            2500 yards west a little bit south of the battalion position. 2nd Lt. George R.
            Bennett, F.O. , was with this force. About 0710 the battalion had fired 488
            rounds on tanks and infantry that was attacking this force. The 41st Inf. was
            outposting the main road leading southwest about one thousand yards in front of
            the 78th and was beating off another enemy attack. The 78th had fired several
            missions at an &quot;88&quot; and supporting infantry about 500 yards to the
            west of the 41st Inf. outpost. A company of infantry from the 4th Inf. Division
            with four tank destroyers was in position about two hedgerows (150 yards) north
            of &quot;B&quot; Battery forming a roadblock across the main paved road. They
            had their half-tracks and supply vehicles in a small grove just across the road
            west of &quot;B&quot; Battery. It was very important that this cross-road be
            held because part of the division mission was to block the escape of the enemy
            in that area.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font face="Verdana">Everyone knew there was still plenty of German equipment
            just north of the crossroad. The 78th had been firing missions at all types of
            enemy tanks, vehicles, infantry, mortars, etc., using both cub and ground
            observers. The 78th AR, FA Bn. had the evening before, fired about 700 rounds to
            stop a break through just north of Notre-Dame de Cenilly. In this general area
            the 78th alone had fired a total of about 1200 rounds the afternoon of the 28
            July 1944.The Division Artillery fired in that area continually. One battery of
            155mm Howitzers had been overrun by the enemy. 1st Lt. William W. Barnett, Jr.
            F.O. for the 78th, had been with the 1st Bn., 67th AR, ever since the break
            through at St. Lo. Lt. Barnett was the F.O that had fired 700 rounds stopping
            the attack on the evening of the 28 July 1944. The morning of 29 July 1944 Lt.
            Barnett was sent with a small task force of tanks and infantry to maintain
            contact with the enemy and find out what was in the area to the north of
            Notre-Dame de Cenilly. They pushed north and then west, firing and pushing the
            enemy back until they were on high ground overlooking the main road that ran
            north from &quot;B&quot; Battery position. At 0610 Lt. Barnett fired 384 rounds
            on tanks and infantry about 1400 yds. due north of the crossroad.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font face="Verdana">About 0800 29 July 1944 there seemed to be a little more
            small arms fire than usual coming from beyond &quot;B&quot; Battery position.
            The Battalion Commander, Lt. Col. H.M Exton, sent the Battalion Reconnaissance
            Officer, Capt. Emmette W. Beuchamp to see what was going on. Capt. Beauchamp
            reported that there were some enemy infantry attacking the 4th Division outpost,
            but that it seemed well in hand . The firing got heavier and heavier, it was
            reported to the CP that a force of 15 enemy tanks and about 250 infantry were
            attacking the outpost. This information was passed on to C.G. CC &quot;B&quot;,
            Gen. I.D White. About 0900 the half -tracks and supply vehicles of the 4th
            Division pulled out toward Notre Dame-de-Cenilly. The enemy heavy mortar fire
            had gotten so bad it was not safe for thin skinned vehicles. The 4th Division's
            company commander was killed and the men disorganized and fell back into
            &quot;B&quot; Battery's position. One tank destroyer was knocked out, and when
            the infantry fell back, the other three pulled out after the supply vehicles.
            This left only the 78th to hold the crossroad. Upon seeing the vehicles pull
            out, (the Bn. CP was just across the road from &quot;B&quot; Battery and on a
            gentle rise) the battalion commander ordered &quot;B&quot; Battery into direct
            fire positions. He dashed across the road and took personal command of
            &quot;B&quot; Battery. Ist. Lt. Thomas G. Morris, &quot;B&quot; Battery
            Executive Officer, already had two M-7's in position pulled into the hedgerow
            facing the enemy. The other four were immediately spotted along the same row.
            Lt. Col. Exton had 1st Lt. Earl D. Davis, AST's Executive Officer, organize all
            the extra personnel in machine gun squads and spotted to cover the M-7's and two
            squads under 2nd Lt. Ralph W. Burke, Battery Reconnaissance Officer; were sent
            to hold the battery's left flank. ( The enemy was trying to go around the
            crossroad to the south) Lt. Robert Kanski, Executive officer of &quot;C&quot;
            Battery , under his direction 4th gun section fired 2 rounds at a distance of
            200 yards at a Mark 1V tank and destroyed it. Lt. Kanski continued to expose
            himself to extreme danger by moving from gun to gun directing fire. Lt. Kanski would receive the Silver Star
            for his heroic
            action, he is an American hero.&nbsp;</font>

                Armored Field Artillery Battalion:</font>
        </a></h1>
    <p>
        <font face="Verdana">The 92nd Armored Artillery Battalion was
            activated on 8 January 1942, the men coming from the 14th and 17th Armored
            Artillery Battalions. Time out please: At noon on 4 July 1944 about 280 guns
            took part in the salute to Independence Day, the 92nd Armored Artillery
            Battalion took part in this celebration effort. During three days on 5- 8 July
            1944, the 92nd Armored Artillery fired in support of the Royal Horse Artillery
            and the 50th British Brigade. The 92th with others helped to break up a
            counterattack west of Hottot, France destroying four tanks and killing eight
            infantry. Prior to the St. Lo.( referred to as operation Cobra ) breakthrough
            the 92nd Armored Artillery Battalion was assigned to the division reserve and to
            be in direct support of the 41st Armored Infantry Regiment (division reserve).
            Division reserve was commanded by <strong>Col. Sidney R. Hinds</strong>.
            Operation <strong>Cobra</strong> started on 25 July 1944 at 0945. On 28 July
            1944 about 0300 in the afternoon a frontal attack was made by the Germans from
            the direction of Cerisy la Salle and directed toward Pont Brocard, &amp; Notre
            Dame De Cenilly. The 92nd Armored Field Artillery was of material assistance in
            breaking up these attacks, some times by direct fire.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font face="Verdana">On the night of 29-30 July 1944 the 92nd
            Artillery, moving to a new position, had to fight its way into its area near
            Bois de Soulles, France. When Combat Command &quot;B&quot; called for fire
            support, the battalion complied although they were also under attack at the
            time. The Germans were so close that one self-propelled howitzer was sent to
            engage a German self-propelled gun with direct fire, while &quot;C&quot; Battery
            faced in another direction to destroy another second gun. Please remember that
            the Armored Field Artillery were very mobile, not by choice but by necessity in
            order to survive. Because of the rapid advance of the 2nd Armored Division
            pockets of heavy resistance were sometimes bypassed causing some concern and
            definite risk to normally units that were supposed to be secure in their
            operation. Artillery units were moving rapidly to keep within range of the
            enemy. When the Germans finally fell back, the artillerymen found 150 dead,
            along with many damaged or abandoned vehicles. About 0100 on 30 July 1944 the
            92nd was called upon to place artillery fire 200 yards in front of the divisions
            main forces to prevent them from a frontal attack by the Germans.</font>

        <font face="Verdana">On 3 October 1944 again crossed the German border
            this time crossing the Wurm River at Marienberg, attacking the Siegfried Line
            frontally. Combat Command &quot;B&quot; consisting of 41st Infantry Regiment,
            76th Armored Regiment,, 78th and 92nd Armored Field Artillery Battalions,
            assisted the 30th Infantry Division in scouring Palenberg, pushing on to take
            Ubach and later Frelenberg, Waurichen, and Beggendorf. On 11-30 October 1944 in
            the vicinity of Neerbeek, the 2nd Armored Division and the German forces
            maintained defensive positions. Employing 110 or more artillery pieces, Division
            artillery fired more than 45,000 rounds into enemy territory during the three
            week period from 11-31 October 1944 Division artillery units included the 14th,
            78th, 92, and attached 65th Armored Field Artillery. Heavy fire was laid into
            the following towns Hongen, Friealdenhoven, Rottgen, Puffendorf, Floverich,
            Gereonsweiler, Setterich, Siersdorf, Geilenkirchen, which were being used as
            communications and assembly centers.</font>

        <font face="Verdana">Later on 9 January 1945 while flushing out the
            Germans around Samree, Belgium the 92th Armored Artillery was shelling a woods
            nearby and flushed out three German tanks two escaped , one destroyed and burned
            on the spot.</font>

        <font face="Verdana">Late on the evening of 28 February 1945 the 92nd
            Armored Artillery Battalion overran and captured a four-gun 105mm battery near
            Grevenbroich, Germany.The advance was so fast that some artillery units had to
            clear their areas of lagging Germans who were left behind by the retreating
            forces in order to setup their guns. On 30 March 1945 the 82nd Reconnaissance
            Battalion was advancing far to the front of the division main forces around the
            Haltern-Dulmen line, that they caught up with a train. Reporting this to
            division this was passed on to the 92nd Armored Artillery, they fired an
            artillery salvo and cut the train in half.. The prisoners taken from the train
            thought that the American forces were still on the other side of the canal (
            Dortmund-Ems Canal ), they had no idea we were on the east side. Then on to
            occupy Berlin for the forty five days in July, August 1945. In 1948 at Ft. Hood,
            Texas Lt. Col. C.E. Stuart was commanding officer.</font>

            Operation Cobra: Co. &quot;C&quot; of the 702nd Tank
            Destroyer Battalion operated with &quot;CCB&quot; during Operation Cobra, while
            the balance of the battalion was attached to support &quot;CCA&quot;. The
            mission of the 3rd platoon of &quot;C&quot; Company was to accompany the advance
            guard or right flank force headed by Maj. William P. Ring, Jr., of the 1st
            battalion, 67th Armored Regiment. Mission of the 1st and 2nd platoons was to
            proceed with the main body the ultimate objective was L'engronne, where these
            two platoons were to assist in establishing road blocks on the three roads
            coming into L'engronne from the north, south, and west.</font>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <font face="Verdana">The 3rd platoon had no action of
            note in accompanying Major Ring's force.. Of the other two platoons, Capt. Lyon
            said the the 2nd platoon had the warmest time. During the German counterattack
            at the la Penetiere crossroads, the 2nd platoon destroyed two Mark IV tanks on
            the night of 28-29 July 1944. From la Penteiere, the 1st and 2nd platoons
            proceeded on 29 July 1944 through St. Martin-de-Cenilly, thence turning
            southwest below St. Martin-de-Cenilly to Hambye, and then southeast through St.
            Denis le Gast toward l'engronne. Capt. Lyon considers that the outstanding
            action of the entire company was the work of a single M10 on the St. Denis-le-Gast
            to L' engronne road on the morning of 30 July 1944, when a German armored column
            was destroyed in front of the 78th Armored Field Artillery Bn.. &quot;CP&quot;
            T/5 Mellon tells the following story of this exploit; Cpl. O'Malley corrected
            grid, corroborated certain details as he went along, until the two agreed on the
            facts. After we passed through St. Denis-le-Gast on 29 July on the way to
            outpost the three roads at L'engronne, we received orders from Gen. White to
            detach two M10's from the rest of the 2 platoons and return to St. Denis-le-Gast
            to assist in protecting that town from the threat of a counterattack. Our M10
            was commanded by Sgt. Kenneth Oxenreider; the other two men besides ourselves
            were Pvt. Wilbur W. Paulk and Pvt. Bruno Wadowski. &quot;About 2300 , we took up
            positions by the cemetery just north of the town of St. Denis-le-Gast.. Just
            before midnight, somebody reported some tanks at the crossroads where the road
            goes to L'engronne we went down to investigate , found the report false, and
            pulled back into our old position by midnight. About that time, German infantry
            started fighting into our position around the cemetery; and we turned to go back
            once more south to the crossroads at (31444). We stayed there for about an hour
            and a half, during which the enemy sent in a lot of mortar fire and threw up
            flares. An M8 assault gun was hit right next to us and went up in flames after a
            mortar hit on the turret. We could be observed very easily and they started
            throwing more mortars at us. We did not see where the other M10 was, but we knew
            we were in a pretty hot spot and it got even more uncomfortable when the enemy
            infantry started to overrun our positions.</font>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <font face="Verdana">&quot;Then a mortar made a direct
            hit on the rear of our M10. The hit knocked out one motor, tearing a hole
            through the rear idler, bent up the bogy, chopped up the track, tore up the
            radiator and punctured the oil pan. So we had only one motor, and that without
            either oil or water.In this condition, we cranked up the motor and decided it
            would be best to try and make our way back to the rest of the company around L'
            engronne. Some lieutenant tried to get us to go up toward the cemetery again,
            but we had better ideas. &quot;The mortar shell caused no casualties among our
            personnel, but Pvt. Wadowski had a slight bullet wound incurred earlier in the
            evening when the German infantry started to come through.. We started down the
            road toward L'engronne, but the motor without oil and water got hotter and
            hotter, and our M10 was pretty difficult to steer. Finally we had to pull off
            the road about 100 yards east of the &quot;CP&quot; of the 78th FA Bn. Our left
            track was still on the road. &quot; It was 0225 ( this would be 2:25 AM in the
            morning) when we called the company commander and told him that we had been
            knocked out, and where we were. He said in reply: &quot;stay there till morning;
            you're in safe territory.&quot; About five minutes after that we heard tanks
            coming west from St. Denis-le-Gast. I could see their guns and big broad tracks,
            so I yelled: 'Here come Heinie tanks'.&quot; &quot;Sgt. Oxenreider got upon the
            turret and wanted to open fire on them immediately, and he grabbed the .50
            caliber gun, but we restrained him and talked him into not firing until after
            the column had passed. &quot; Peculiarly enough, the Germans did not bother us
            at all when they passed by. We kept quiet, and the hatch open. They must have
            seen the damage caused to the rear of the M10, and must have thought it was just
            another abandoned, knocked out vehicle.&quot;After the entire column had passed
            our position, we could hear the start of the commotion up ahead as the 78th
            began to challenge the lead vehicle. The last vehicle was only 20-25 yards ahead
            of us. A minute or two later, a .50 caliber from a 78th's half-track started
            firing at the German column. Immediately, Cpl. O'Malley traversed our 3&quot;
            gun around to the left and lowered it for direct fire on the last vehicle in the
            line, which was a big personnel carrier with a load of German infantry. &quot;I
            could observe through the hatch and yelled throw a round in and let 'em have
            it.&quot; Pvt. Wadowski loaded the gun once, and as the breech-block slammed the
            German infantry in the personnel carrier started to catch on fire and they
            yelled 'Kamerad, Kamerad..! We just commenced firing,, but they didn't fire
            back, just continued to yell 'Kamerad.' The first round ignited the personnel
            carrier, and then we started the fire up the column. We fired a total of 28
            rounds up the column. When the 78th started leveling their M7's for direct fire
            from the front of the column, the fire was coming in our direction and we had to
            dismount and move off the road to the north. We gave Wadowski first aid, but
            none of the rest of the crew was hurt.&quot;</font>

            redesignated the 301st Tank Battalion ( Heavy) . In the fall of 1917. It was
            shipped to England where British Mark V and Mark V star tanks were drawn. This
            was done near Wool, England in a Tank Training Center In the summer of 1918 the
            battalion went to France where it received its battle initiation with the
            American Infantry 27th Division.. assigned to the 301st Tank Brigade under which
            it fought on the plains of Picardy, France through the end of World War I. The
            301st first battle was the attack on the Hindenburg Line in September 1918,
            where it suffered heavy losses from anti-tank mines. After the Armistice it was
            banded together with the 303rd Tank Brigade under the command of General George
            S. Patton . In 1919 then Col. Patton brought the Brigade back to Camp Meade,
            Maryland. In 1931 it combined with the Infantry School at Ft. Benning Georgia.
            In 1932 became the medium tank Regiment known as 67th Armored Regiment.&nbsp; As

        <font face="Verdana">From my recollections, 1st 67th Armor, 1st or 2nd 50th
            Infantry and a signal unit [52nd?] were relocated to Germany during the first
            rotation from roughly February, 1975 through August 1975. A battalion of the
            66th Armor, and other sundry support units, followed during the second rotation
            shortly before I was discharged from service. Friends of mine in both 66th and
            67th Armor later told me that each unit in the 2 AD rotated to Germany for six
            month stints at a time until all units had spent brief tours on European soil.
            Apparently this was the US Army's means of bolstering NATO unit strengths
            without the spousal and dependent baggage that frequently follows GI's in
            assignments around the world. Two of my friends actually PCSed to Germany
            independent of 2 AD's unit rotations and gave me some interesting accounts of
            some of these units on temporary overseas deployment after my own discharge.</font>

        <font face="Verdana">Your reports of 67th Armor's deployment in 1978-79 would
            suggest to me that this unit rotation scheme, or some variant of it, was still

        <font face="Verdana">First Lieutenant Lawrence Cane, 0-1110976 Corps of Engineers, 238th Engineer
            Combat Battalion, United States Army. For gallantry in action on 30 July 1944 in
            France. During the night of 30 July 1944, the advance guard of Combat Command
            &quot;B&quot;, 2d Armored Division, consisting of some thirty medium tanks and
            forty other motor vehicles, was in danger of encirclement and annihilation by
            superior enemy forces attempting to break out of a trap. Lieutenant Cane,
            despite intense enemy small arms and mortar fire volunteered to personally
            reconnoiter a route for these vehicles and tanks in order to contact friendly
            forces. The reconnaissance was made in complete darkness at a time when the
            enemy situation was unknown, and resulted in encountering strong enemy patrols
            which infiltrated into the area and cut the roads. The enemy halted Lieutenant
            Cane's repeated attempts to find a route with intense machine gun and small arms
            fire. Despite these factors and with complete disregard for his personal safety,
            Lieutenant Cane voluntarily and determinedly continued his reconnaissance and
            found a safe route of withdrawal. By means or the route discovered by this
            reconnaissance, the tanks and vehicles were safely evacuated to the 2d Armored
            Division Reserve and saved from possible encirclement and destruction. Entered

            1941 up until February of 1942, when Major John S. Wier became the Battalion
            Commander.He asked for surgical trucks, the army give him six thousand dollars
            and told him to build his own surgical trucks. He took 6 two-and-a-half-ton
            -trucks and built them. The battalion was sent to Africa, landing in the
            Casablanca Safi area in 1942. In the spring of 1943 they proceeded to Arzew in
            Algeria, then on to Tunis. On to Sicily and then to England and Tidworth
            Barracks for and extended period of time. The battalion landed on Omaha beach on
            D+3 at 1:00PM. Col. Maurice Rose had gone over with the advance party and was
            already on the beach and told them that the infantry was about 5 miles in, The
            battalion stayed with the 2nd Armored Div. throughout the advance on into
            Germany and then to Berlin. Col. Wier said: &quot;quote,&quot; Our biggest
            problem during the Battle of the Bulge from a medical standpoint was frostbite.
            This is one time when supply had failed us. We had no adequate winter clothing,
            We had no overshoes. We were fighting in snow , sometimes up to 3 feet deep. The
            temperature went down to well below zero every night, and fog would roll in from
            the sea and coat everything with ice.&quot;end quote.&quot; Our medic in
            &quot;A&quot; Co. 82nd Recon's name was Everett W. Christenson, we called him
            Chris, he was with us until January 12, 1945. On this day we were ordered to
            take three squads up into the snow covered mountains near Samree, Belgium, and
            try to clean out a small group of Germans holding out there. We drove our
            vehicles as far as we safely could up into the mountain into a clearing a short
            distance from where we were to dismount and organize the squads to advance. We
            were dressed not for this kind of weather, no overshoes or wool clothing of any
            kind. It was so cold the snow made a crunching noise under your feet, we could
            hardly keep our hands warm enough to fire our weapons. As we advanced into the
            trees three of our men were shot immediately within a few minutes and we were
            signaled to pull back if we could but we continued to get fire which made it
            difficult to pull back, one man got up to go back and was shot before he made
            his second step. Chris our medic went to him and was kneeling down trying to
            give him first aid and was killed instantly. He was wearing his Medic arm band
            on each arm. We lost four men killed and three wounded. We found out later that
            almost a regiment of Germans was in the woods, they were all dressed in white to
            blend with the snow, we couldn't even see them if they did not make some kind of
            movement. All the Medics were there when we needed them, the 48th Medical
            Battalion deserves much appreciation</font>

            Ardennes. And later would play an important role in the success of the 2nd
            Armored Division in its rapid advance across the northern plains of Germany.

            I
            served in the 2AD with 3/41IN in both Garlstedt and at Ft. Hood. (I was assigned
            to Battalion S-3, NBC NCOIC) and was involved in the first unit rotation (Ft.
            Hood - Garlstedt) in 1986.<br>
            I have many B/W photographs of unit rotation ceremonies conducted at Ft.<br>
            Hood. I also redesigned the 3/41IN certificate of achievement in 1984, which<br>
            was adopted for use in 1985. In fact, I have the original prototype. I also<br>
            possess two 2AD (Fwd) coins that were provided to soldiers for outstanding<br>
            effort. One of these coins reflects 3/41 IN and 323 Panzer Grenadier<br>
            Battalion partnership (then, sister units) I also have several newspapers<br>
            that were published on the Kaserne about 2AD, called <u>The Forward Edge</u>. Is<br>
            this the kind of historical information you are looking for? Yes this is what we
            are looking for Brian, We thank you.&nbsp;<br>
