        armored divisions formed by the United States Army. The division was
        placed under the command of Brigadier General George S. Scott Jr.,
        General George S. Patton Jr. relieved General Scott in September 1940.
        The original 2nd Armored Division, created as a miniature army built

<p><font face="Verdana">The 82nd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion was activated as
a part of the Second Armored Division, 15 July 1940, at Ft. Benning, Georgia. It
was at that time called the 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion. The skeleton
organization was made up of trained key personnel drawn from cavalry and
reconnaissance units located throughout the United States. On 24 July 1940, the
first cadre, consisting of 89 men, arrived from the 1st Reconnaissance
Battalion, Fort Knox, Kentucky, a similar organization formed a few days
previously from the 7th Cavalry Brigade. Eight men came from the 2nd Squadron,
3rd Cavalry, at Fort. Meyer, Va., and eight from the 1st Squadron, 3rd Cavalry,
at Fort Allen, Vt.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The 3rd Cavalry Regiment began its famous career in 1846,
when it was formed as a &quot; Regiment of the Mounted Riflemen&quot;. Through
many campaigns the 3rd Cavalry has lived up to its motto, &quot; Brave Rifles,
Veterans, you have been baptized in fire and blood and come out steel&quot;...
the immortal words of General Winfield Scott after the battle of Chapaultepec.
Twenty six men later arrived from the 2nd Cavalry at Fort Riley, Kansas. The
2nd, was one of the oldest cavalry in the United States Army, has a long and
brilliant record dating back to 1836, when it was formed by an act of Congress
as the 2nd Dragoons. Twenty-three men whose parent organization was the 11th
Cavalry Regiment completed the cadre on 11 August 1901. The 11th Cavalry, formed
at Fort Meyer, Virginia, distinguished itself in the Spanish-American war, and
in General Pershing's punitive expedition against Mexico in 1914.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Proud of its distinguished lineage, the 82nd Armored
Reconnaissance Battalion, the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of the Second Armored
Division, has already added new battle honors to those handed down to it by its
parent units.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">The 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion, formed
from a cadre supplied by the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 11th, 13th, and 14th Cavalry
Regiments, was activated as an organic unit. Its first commanding officer was
Major, later Major General) Isaac D. White, who as a brigadier general,
commanded the division from 19 January 1945 to 8 June 1945. ( more on Gen. White
in the Generals section) When the division was reorganized on 8 January 1942,
following the Carolina maneuvers, the 2nd was redesignated the 82nd Armored
Reconnaissance Battalion. During those maneuvers the battalion made national
headlines by its first notable feat of arms-the capture of Lt. General Hugh A.
Drum, CG of the First Army. An interesting point, most all of the generals to
command the 2nd Armored Division were from the New England States.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">Three platoons of the 82nd were a part of
the initial landing force which forced the capitulation of French North Africa.
On 8 November 1942, one platoon of Co. &quot;C&quot; landed at Safi, with Combat
Command &quot;B&quot; another platoon landed at Fedala, near Casablanca, with
the 9th Infantry Division and a third landed at Mahdia Plage, near Port Lyautey,
with the 3rd Infantry Division.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">The 82nd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion
landed at Gela, Sicily on 11th July 1943. The battalion took a major part in the
capture of Butera and the tank company participated in the battle of Mazzarino.
The battalion reconnoitered in front of the division during the advance on
Palermo, brushing aside the enemy road blocks at San Guisseppe Pass. On 22 July
the attack on Palermo began with elements of the battalion covering the
division's flank. After the capture of Palermo, the 82nd was a part of the
Palermo Military District administering prisoners of war.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font color="#000000">On 9 June 1944, reinforced by Co.
&quot;D&quot; of the 17th Armored Engineer Battalion, the battalion landed on
Omaha Beach in Normandy as a part of Combat Command &quot;A&quot;. During the
St. Lo breakthrough in July 1944 the battalion was attached to Combat Command
&quot;B&quot; and performed in an outstanding manner, pushing rapidly across
Cherbourg peninsula to secure crossings over the Seine river.</font> <font color="#000000">The

up actions with Combat Command &quot;A&quot; in the vicinity of Maastricht,
Holland the battalion defended the left of the bridgehead over the Maas River,
near Sittard, Holland to enable Combat Command &quot;B&quot; to concentrate for
the attack on the Siegfried line.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">The battalion took part in the penetration
of the Siegfried line and Co. &quot;D&quot; was the nucleus of a task force

<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">During the first phase of the &quot;Battle
of the Bulge&quot; (Ardennes Offensive) in Belgium, the 82nd Reconnaissance
Battalion, less one company and two platoons, was attached to Combat Command
&quot;A&quot;. One company of the battalion was with Combat Command
&quot;B&quot;. In the second phase of the battle in the Ardennes, the battalion
was attached to Combat Command &quot;A&quot; and made contact with the <strong>Third
Army sealing the &quot;Bulge&quot; near Houffalize.</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">During the drive from the Roer River to
the Rhine, the battalion protected the division left flank, maintaining contact
with the 29th Infantry Division on the left.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">For operations from 3 April 1945 through
17 April 1945 during the sweep from the Rhine to the Elbe, the 82nd
Reconnaissance Battalion received the Presidential Unit Citation. The operation
consisted of slashing through the enemy's defenses for more than 250 miles,
always far in advance of the main elements of the spearhead force. The advance
was climaxed by a spectacular dash of 62 miles from Gross Manner to the Elbe
River south of Magdeburg in eight hours.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">Aggressive movements of the widely
separated companies of the battalion completely disrupted the enemy defenses and
resulted in the killing of 1,000 enemy troops and the capture of 8,943
prisoners, the capture of and the destruction of large quantities of enemy
equipment and the liberation of approximately 32,000 allied prisoners of war
land slave laborers. From 7 May 1945 to 1 January 1946 the 82nd Reconnaissance
Battalion performed occupational roles which included the initial occupation of
Berlin. The battalion sailed from Calais on 21 January 1946 and arrived in Ft.
Hood, Texas on 12 February 1946 where routine training and housekeeping duties
were performed. On 22 November 1946, the battalion was deactivated and zeroed
out thus ending, for a time, a unit which had gained glory and distinction
during its short life.</font></p>

following which it acted as aggressor troops against other units of the
division, and again distinguished itself by outstanding display of initiative,

<p><b><font color="#000000" face="Verdana">More on the history of the 82nd</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Dear Mr. Swonger. 1 have had an opportunity to view your web site and noticed
the history of the 82nd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion. Perhaps you might be
interested in the following which was taken from the &quot;.Army Lineage Series,
Armor-Cavalry, Part 1&quot; by Mary Lee Stubbs and Stanley Russell Conner.
Office of the Chief of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D. C .
1969. It appears that the 82nd was consolidated with the 1st&quot; Battalion,
15th Armor and the battle honors earned by the 82nd are now carried by that
unit. I do not know if you are familiar with the Combat Arms Regimental System
(CARS) If you are not, the following (excerpted from the above listed book)
might be helpful</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The decade following the Korean armistice was marked by two major
reorganizations of U.S. Army divisions, both of which influenced the structure
of armor units: First to come was the pentomic plan of 1957-59, then the
Reorganization Objective Army Divisions (ROAD) plan of 1962-64 Concurrent with
the division reorganizations, another major change having far-reaching effect
upon the organization of most combat-type units was the Combat Arms Regimental
System, or CARS Arrival of the atomic era with its new weapons and tactical
doctrine had rendered the regiment, the traditional fighting unit of the Army
obsolete--it was too large.&nbsp; Even during World War II armored regiments,
except those of the 2&quot;d and 3&quot; Armored Divisions, were broken up to
form separate battalions, and many old cavalry regiments had been dismembered to
form new units. With approval of the CARS plan early in 1957, the old cavalry
and armored regiments could be revived, at least in name, to continue their
regimental histories&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The plan provided an average of approximately fifteen battalions that could
be organized to perpetuate the lineage and honors of a single regiment. The
regimental headquarters was placed under Department of the Army control, and the
other regimental elements were used to form separate battalions or squadrons as
needed. Within these battalions and squadrons the organic elements were new
Parent regiments for use under CARS were carefully selected. Except for the 2nd,
3rd, 6th 11th and 14 Armored Cavalry regiments, the 1st through the 17th Cavalry
regiments were included Armor parent regiments were the 32nd through the 35th,
the 37th, 40th, 63rd, 64th, the 66th through the 70th, and the 72nd,73rd, 77th
and 81<sup>st</sup>, A subsequent decision by the Department of the Army that
CARS cavalry regiment would contain reconnaissance-type units instead of tank
battalions caused the redesignation of three cavalry regiments-the 13th, 15th
and 16<sup>th</sup>---as the 13th, 15th and 16th Armor. Not affected by this
decision were those elements of the 5th, 7<sup>th</sup> and 8th Cavalry,
assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division, which remained organized as infantry. When
the CARS reorganization was completed, cavalry had 9 regiments and armor had 20
Elements of these parent regiments were organized in both the Regular Army and
the Army Reserve Army National Guard parent regiments were selected from
