                <font face="Verdana">Late in the evening of 15 September 1944 the company moved
                    out following the Division Artillery and crossed the Albert Canal at Canne,
                    Belgium, just east of the famous Fort Eben Emael, about midnight. Just beyond
                    the Albert Canal they crossed from Belgium into Holland, adding another country
                    to their growing list. Pulling off the road about one mile west of the city of
                    Maastricht the Company waited until daylight and proceeded through that city
                    crossing the Meuse on another pontoon bridge and set up the Regimental Command
                    Post about 2 miles east of the river.( 16 Sept. ) The enemy was stiffening his
                    resistance now, with his own country’s border at his back. The forward
                    elements drove relentlessly ahead and the next day (17 Sept. ) the Company moved
                    to Meerssen, a distance of about 7 miles. Just after dark 4 Germans were
                    discovered near the Command Post by Staff Sergeant Riggs, when they attempted to
                    run Riggs fired his tommy gun wounding one and taking the others prisoner. In
                    the morning (18 Sept.) the Company moved to Sweikhuizen about 10 miles north
                    where Captain William H. Schlifke joined the Headquarters taking over the duties
                    of Graves Registration and Prisoners of War evacuation. The forward elements of
                    the Regiment had crossed the German border, the first troops of the division
                    reached German soil. Headquarters Company moved to Wintraak on the 19th and on
                    the 20th after the Regiment had been relieved moved back to Klimmen, Holland,
                    about 1 mile east of Valkenburg. They remained in this area until the 4th of
                    October. The time was spent on maintenance and rehabilitation. The men had a
                    chance to see movies, the first time most for most of them since leaving
                    England. The kitchen, band, and supply section were brought up and &quot; B
                    &quot; rations were issued the kitchen. Everyone had a chance to relax somewhat
                    and enjoy a few comforts while they could for they knew full well the big task
                    still lay ahead.</font>

                    Colonel Clifton B. Batchelder)</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">In the evening of 9 September 1944 the Battalion moved to
                    an area near Neerveld, south of Herck La Ville. Outposts and patrols were
                    maintained, but no enemy contact was established. The battalion remained in this
                    bivouac until the 14th of September, when it moved to an area just southwest of
                    the Albert Canal in the vicinity of Maastricht. On the 17th , the Battalion,
                    still Division Reserve, crossed the canal and the river, moved through
                    Maastricht to an area 3 miles north of the city. Here orders were received to
                    attack along the Maastricht-Sittard highway to seize the railroad and the
                    surrounding territory at the point where the highway crossed it just south of
                    Sittard. As the attack jumped off, &quot; D &quot; Company under Captain Lester
                    M. Rice deployed to the right of the road, with &quot; H &quot; Company under
                    Lieutenant William H. Hough on the left. &quot; A &quot; company with the
                    mortars and assaults was in support of both elements initially. While deploying,
                    the tanks were attacked by enemy anti-tank guns. &quot; D &quot; and &quot; H
                    &quot; Company lost each 3 tanks before the guns were silenced. While rounding
                    up prisoners, Lieutenant Lee caught a German officer attempting to pull a palm
                    pistol from his shoulder holster. Lee a giant of a man, picked him up and
                    slammed him against the building beside he had lined up the prisoners, breaking
                    his neck and back. Enemy artillery and mortar fire was extremely heavy; one
                    shell burst close to Lee’s tank, wounding two of his crew and inflicting neck
                    and thigh wounds on Lieutenant Lee. Despite his own painful wounds, he picked up
                    his two wounded crew members and carried them down the road ¼ of a mile to the
                    aid station. He then returned to his tank, but the Battalion Commander ordered
                    him to permit himself to be evacuated. The attack continued against bitter
                    opposition. An &quot; A &quot; Company tank was struck by a heavy artillery
                    shell, wounding all of the crew. By nightfall, the objective was secured. In the
                    morning (18 Sept.), the Battalion and attachments proceeded to push toward
                    Sittard, white the objective of securing the high ground to the north of the
                    town. Because of intensity of enemy artillery concentrations, it was decided to
                    leave the rear command post north of Maastricht, and establish a forward command
                    post of the command tank with advanced elements. Lieutenant Francis M. Wilson,
                    in attempting to reach the forward command post , was killed by a German sniper,
                    and his peep driver, Technician Fifth Grade Jesse Sykes, narrowly escaped as a
                    group of enemy riflemen sent slugs whistling into the steering column, the
                    radio, and one of the tires. An enemy plane attempting to strafe the Battalion
                    came a little too low for safety, and was sent crashing in flames by the
                    well-directed 50 caliber fire of the medium tankers. &quot; A &quot; Company’s
                    light tanks with some of the infantry from &quot; A &quot; Company 41st Armored
                    Infantry Regiment, succeeded in pushing their way into town, where they set up
                    security for the night. The enemy had consolidated behind them, and the
                    remainder of the battalion stayed just south of the town until the next day.
                    During the night, one of the &quot; A &quot; Company tanks was knocked out by
                    bazooka fire. Civilians reported that the enemy repaired the tank and drove it
                    away. On 19 September the rest of the force continued into town , and after 12
                    hours of fighting in the streets succeeded in clearing it. In the meantime,
                    Lieutenant Oliver A. Lewis led his platoon of &quot; A &quot; Company tanks in a
                    dash over the German border to Tuddern, which, with the help of the infantry,
                    they succeeded in capturing and outposting. During this action, Lieutenant Lewis
                    flushed over 300 prisoners from the hedgerows on the outskirts of the town. On
                    20 September, the Battalion was relieved and moved south to an area 1 ½ miles
                    northeast of Valkenburg, Holland, where it was attached to Combat Command &quot;
                    B &quot;. Here a program of maintenance and rehabilitation was undertaken.
                    Recreational facilities were limited to movies and an occasional camp show. The
                    battalion intensified its training of personnel for the coming campaign to smash
                    through the Siegfried Line into the heart of enemy’s territory.</font>

            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">On 14 September 1944, less the force that had been sent to
                    the Third Battalion, 41st Armored Infantry Regiment, the Battalion moved at
                    07.00 hours and closed in another assembly area at 08.20 hours near Vlijtingen,
                    where Company &quot;F&quot; and the light tank platoon joined the Battalion at
                    10.00 Hours. The were preparing to cross the Albert Canal; all that delayed them
                    was the completion of the bridge at Canne. The bridge collapsed at 19.00 hours
                    and the Battalion remained there all night. Company &quot;G&quot; of the 41st
                    Armored Infantry Regiment joined them at the same time that the rest of the
                    force rejoined. While waiting for the bridge to be put up again the Battalion
                    remained in its present position until 20.00 hours at which time it moved
                    through Kesselt and crossed the Albert Canal at Canne, continuing the march
                    through<b> </b>Maastricht and across the Wilhelms Canal. At about 23.30 hours it
                    crossed the Meuse River (Maas) and moved into an assembly area two miles east of<b>
                    </b>Maastricht at 0200 hours on 16 September. Reports indicated that the enemy
                    was in the immediate vicinity. Patrols were sent out and they returned about
                    07.00 hours with the information that the bridges were blown and that the
                    Germans were entrenched in the area just north of these bridges. The force
                    attempted to cross the stream at 08.00 hours with a platoon of infantry and a
                    platoon of tanks, but the infantry was held up by heavy, mortar, artillery and
                    small arms fire. The remainder of the infantry was brought up and they were
                    supported by Company &quot;F&quot;, the mortar and assault gun platoons, and the
                    artillery. Company &quot;E&quot; and Company &quot;B&quot; remained in reserve.
                    In spite of the heavy fire one platoon of infantry crossed the stream at 13.00
                    hours and another crossed at 14.00 hours. The engineer platoon began work on a
                    treadway bridge, but the progress was slow because of the heavy incoming fire. A
                    request for air support was fulfilled at 16.00 hours and they bombed and strafed
                    till 18.00 hours. At 20.00 hours the bridge was completed, and the Battalion
                    prepared to hold for the night, using Company &quot;B&quot; light tanks to
                    protect the flanks and to reinforce the infantry and engineers. Prior to
                    crossing the bridge the next morning (17 Sept.) patrols were sent out to
                    determine the enemy's strength. They received heavy small arms fire. At 09.00
                    hours, watches having been set back one hour, two platoons of medium tanks were
                    across and an attack was launched against the town of St. Gerlach which was
                    captured by 12.00 hours, and the remainder of the Battalion was then brought
                    across. Immediately it pushed toward an objective 1000 yards northeast of St.
                    Gerlach. This was reached at 13.00 hours. It continued toward the second
                    objective, 1000 yards north of objective 1. Company &quot;F&quot; passed through
                    Company &quot;E&quot; which had led the attack to this time. The second
                    objective was attained by Company &quot;F&quot;. Patrols were sent out toward
                    the third objective, but reported no contact. Very close air support, commencing
                    at 11.00 hours and continuing through-out the afternoon, helped considerably. An
                    enemy 75 mm anti-tank gun, in ambush, near the first objective scored a hit on
                    the Battalion Commander's tank, causing slight damage and wounding one man.
                    Company &quot;E&quot; destroyed this gun in short order. That night the
                    Battalion set up on the three objectives, splitting its forces to hold them. The
                    next day (18 Sept.) Company &quot;E&quot;, reinforced with a platoon of infantry
                    and a platoon of light tanks moved out and crossed the Line of Departure.
                    Company &quot;F&quot;, with two platoons of infantry, one platoon light tanks,
                    and one platoon of engineers, followed. Com-pany &quot; F &quot; reached the
                    first objective at 08.00 hours and continued toward objective 2. Light enemy
                    resistance was encountered so Company &quot;F&quot; deployed and the engineers
                    were brought up to repair the bridges in this area. A bridge was found intact
                    and the second objective was gained by enveloping it from the left flank. At
                    15.00 hours the Battalion moved toward objective 3, and soon occupied it. There
                    the Battalion consolidated and pushed on to objectives 4 and 5. The patrol to
                    objective 4, reported no opposition, but did encounter some light resistance on
                    5, Wintraak; this opposition withdrew, and the position was taken and secured by
                    16.30 hours. Preparations were immediately made to attack the sixth objective
                    which was a piece of high ground just to the north of Wintraak and inside the
                    German border. The first platoon of Company &quot;F&quot; commanded by
                    Lieutenant George Adler was the first element of the Battalion to enter German
                    soil, and they quickly gained the high ground which was Objective 6. Thus, the
                    Second Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment became the first unit of the Second
                    Armored Division to enter, conquer and occupy German soil. Company &quot;E&quot;
                    then passed through. Objective 6, led by Lieutenant Kiley who led the attack on
                    Objective 7, the town of Wehr, Germany. Company &quot;E&quot; gained a high hill
                    overlooking the town from the south and cut all roads leading into the town from
                    the east, west and south. As dark-ness fell the Battalion consolidated its
                    positions, again placing its forces in three objectives, 5, 6 and 7. Shortly
                    after dark Lieutenant Colonel John D. Wynne, Battalion Commander, and Lieutenant
                    George Hore, commanding Company &quot;F&quot;, while on an inspection tour near
                    the tank destroyer platoon, ran into a series of entrenchments still occupied by
                    the enemy on Objective 6. A short fight at very close range soon ended with
                    several German dead and 24 taken prisoner.</font>

                <font face="Verdana">On the 15th of September, the Battalion received orders
                    that they, with the 3rd Battalion 41st Armored Infantry Regiment (less Company
                    &quot;G&quot;) attached would cross bridges over the Albert Canal and the Meuse
                    River at Maastricht, Holland, and then would push on to the north along road to
                    Sittard until contact was made with the enemy. When the contact was made the
                    unit would coil for the night. Lt. Bobroff , 9th T. A. Force, Air Support
                    Officer, reported with another officer, some enlisted men and a tank to replace
                    W. O. Donald O. Manning who had been acting as Air Support Officer. The
                    Battalion moved out after some delay and the Albert Canal was crossed at about
                    18.15 hours. The Battalion entered Holland, at 19.00 hours, and continued on
                    thru the city of Maastricht. The streets were packed with the people, dressed in
                    their finest clothes, who had come to bid them welcome to their city and
                    country. The Albert Canal and the Meuse River were crossed on pontoon bridges
                    that had been constructed the previous night and during the day. They continued
                    on along the Maastricht-Sittard highway until the advanced elements were stopped
                    by blown bridges and small arms fire along the Geul River. The Bat-talion coiled
                    for the night and established the necessary blocks and out posts, along the
                    three main river crossings. During the night, the 3rd platoon, Company
                    &quot;B&quot;, 17th Engineers, commanded by Lt. Reed, prepared a bridge for the
                    battalion to make the river crossing, amid continual mortar and small arms fire.
                    The bridge was not completed after another bridge was found to be intact a
                    little farther upstream. The next morning (16 Sept.), the battalion was alerted
                    to be prepared to move across the Geul River and support the Infantry companies,
                    then push thru them and continue the attack thru Hoogveld, Holland, and take the
                    high ground near Beek, Holland. At 1330, Company &quot;I&quot;, 67th , Armored
                    Regiment with the mortar platoon attached was ordered forward across the river.
                    Company &quot;G&quot;, 67th Armored Regiment was attached to the 1st Battalion,
                    41st Armored Infantry Regiment. Later Company &quot;I&quot; and the mortar
                    platoon were instructed to push forward as quickly as possible and after passing
                    thru the infantry, to secure the high ground at Kruisberg. The remainder of the
                    battalion was ordered to move closer to the bridge and to cross as soon as space
                    was available. After moving to the new area, the battalion halted temporarily,
                    while Company &quot;I&quot; (less 1 platoon), plus the combat elements of the
                    41st Armored Infantry Regiment moved forward to secure their objective. The 3rd
                    platoon, Co. &quot;I&quot;, commanded by 1st Lt. Harry S. Woods, pushed up the
                    Maastricht-Sittard highway, supported by one platoon of infantry and secured the
                    objective. During the attack, 2nd Lt. Tom G. Katsilometes, platoon leader,
                    Company &quot; I &quot;, 67th Armored Regiment, and two infantry officers were
                    killed by artillery fire. During the day the attacking forces captured over one
                    hundred prisoners and destroyed many others. The terrain was very unsuitable for
                    tank warfare because of the impossibility of getting off the road. On the
                    morning of the 17th of September, Company &quot; G &quot;, 67th Armored Regiment
                    was attached to the 1st Battalion, 41st Armored Infantry Regiment for the coming
                    operation. All company commanders reported to the Battalion Command Post for
                    orders at 05.30 hours. At this time orders were issued for the assault force
                    commanded by Lt. Col. Crowley, which consisted of &quot; I &quot; Company, 67th
                    A.R., &quot; H &quot; Company 41st Inf. and the mortar platoons of the 3rd Bn.
                    67th A.R. and also of the 3rd Bn. 41st Inf., to press the attack along the axis
                    to the objective No. 1 (620 580) and No. 2 (632 582) and be prepared to assist
                    the 67th A. R. force in securing objective No. 3 at (650 585). Company &quot; B
                    &quot; , 702nd T. D. Battalion (less one platoon) was ordered to follow the
                    assault force. This organization would in turn be followed by the advance
                    Command Post, engineer platoon, assault platoon, &quot; C &quot; Company, and
                    &quot; I &quot; Company, 41st Infantry (less one platoon). The rear Command Post
                    and trains were ordered to remain in their present area. The rear guard
                    consisting of one platoon of &quot; I &quot; Company, 41st Infantry and the
                    Assault platoon of the 3rd Battalion was also to remain in the present area. The
                    platoon of &quot; C &quot; Company at the bridge was ordered to be attached, to
                    &quot; A &quot; Company, 41st Infantry. At 10.05 hours, the Battalion was
                    heavily engaged along the line of departure. Heavy fire was received from
                    artillery and direct fire weapons in the north. As this fire was coming in on
                    the left flank, it halted the advance of the Battalion. At this point word was
                    received that the 1st Battalion, 67th A.R., would pass through the Battalion's
                    position and, advance to the N.E. along the Maastricht-Sittard highway. This was
                    accomplished about 13.30 hours. Heavy resistance was encountered by the 1st Bn,
                    67th A.R., but this action relieved the pressure on this Battalion and enabled
                    them to advance and secure objective 1 at Ulestraten where elements of the 2nd
                    Bn. were also encountered advancing to the north. The Battalion then proceeded
                    to objective No. 2 and on to the town of Oensel which was secured and outposted
                    by 19.30 hours. The results of the day's action were 3 enemy artillery pieces
                    and 3 tanks destroyed; over 200 prisoners captured. Our losses were: one tank
                    disabled, tank can be repaired. During the night Lt. Bert C. Holmes,
                    Reconnaissance platoon leader, while on patrol with two of his 1/4 ton vehicles,
                    ran into a friendly minefield. Lt. Holmes and six enlisted men were evacuated.
                    One 1/4 ton vehicle was destroyed. S/Sgt. Pastierik took over command of the
                    platoon. During the afternoon, an AP shell hit a 67th A. R. Service Company
                    truck parked in the trains area. The shell hit a 75 mm. ammunition cluster,
                    passed through the roof of the truck and on through the windshield into the
                    ground about 10 feet in front of the truck. Personnel standing only three or
                    four feet away were not injured. Lt. Koath A. Beichley, Mortar Platoon leader,
                    was evacuated to the hospital. Staff Sergeant Capbell took over command of the
                    platoon. During the night orders were received from the Division Reserve
                    commander, At 15.10 hours, Lt. Col, Hillyard issued orders for movement of the
                    Battalion to an assembly area in the vicinity of Beek. Upon arriving in this
                    area the Battalion reverted to Combat Command &quot; B &quot; control and was
                    designated as Combat Command &quot; B &quot; reserve. A meeting was held at
                    11.15 hours to brief organizational commanders. The Battalion again returned to
                    control of the 41st Inf., with the 3rd platoon, &quot; B &quot; Company 17th
                    Engineers and &quot; I &quot; Company 41st Infantry attached and with &quot; G
                    &quot; Company still detached. The Battalion was ordered to<b> </b>move
                    following the 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry, gain contact with this organization,
                    move around it and take objective &quot; A &quot; (town of Limbricht) about 6
                    miles to the northeast. The order of march was: advance guard, one platoon,
                    &quot; I &quot; Company<b>, </b>67th , Armored Regiment plus one platoon &quot;
                    I &quot; Company, 41st Infantry with Mortars prepared to protect and extend
                    flanks. The rest of the column was made up of the command group, 17th Engineers
                    platoon, &quot; I &quot; Company 67th Armored Regiment (less one platoon), one
                    platoon &quot; I &quot; Company 41st Infantry, Trains, and infantry platoon as
                    rear guard. Orders were received to move the Battalion forward and find routes
                    to objective &quot; A &quot;. The Battalion moved to the line of departure at
                    14.00 hours. Commanders were again briefed on the ground and attack ordered to
                    jump off at 16.15 hours. Infantry was dug-in along Berg-Voorstad road. The
                    attack started as scheduled and proceeded without incident except for cleaning
                    up infantry pockets to a point 1000 yards from Guttecoven.<b> </b>At this point
                    orders were received to &quot; cease forward advance and consolidate positions
                    and clean out Krauts &quot;. A force was sent to secure the towns of Limbricht,
                    Einighausen and Guttecoven. The Command Post closed at 20.45 hours. An attempt
                    was made to block road junction at Beukeboom but direct fire from heavy weapons
                    held off the force. A listening post was established. Enemy mines were located
                    at that point. The operations for the day were very successful. 400 enemy
                    prisoners were taken. At least 75 were killed throughout the day. Orders were
                    received at 06.30 hours that the Division would continue the attack to the north
                    and east Combat Command &quot; B &quot; would advance with the 1st Battalion,
                    41st Infantry, advancing at 07.00 hours to clean out Sittard and continue the
                    attack to the east. The Battalion was to hold the present position until
                    relieved by the 82nd Reconnaissance Battalion. Upon release, the Battalion was
                    to send patrols to Limbricht and Millen to secure Millen. At 11.45 hours the
                    commanding officers were instructed that the 82nd Reconnaissance had taken over
                    the battalion's positions and they could<b> </b>continue their advance to secure
                    Millen. The Battalion was ordered to move into Germany at Millen with following
                    order of march: Covering force, &quot; C &quot; Company (less two platoons), the
                    advance guard made up of one platoon &quot; I &quot; Company, 67th Armored
                    Regiment and one platoon &quot; I &quot; Company, 41st Infantry, the Mortar
                    platoon, the Assault platoon and the Command Post group. The main body consisted
                    of &quot; I &quot; Company, 67th Armored Regiment, &quot; I &quot; Company, 41st
                    Infantry and trains. The rear guard would be the 1st platoon of &quot; I &quot;
                    Company, 41st Infantry. By 12.00 hours, the platoon of &quot; C &quot; Company
                    with the reconnaissance force was at a railroad underpass which was found to be
                    blown. Enemy was spotted along the railroad and a few prisoners were taken. By
                    12.30 hours,<b> </b>another crossing of the railroad was located. This crossing
                    was made through underpass, and the force continued across country to the site
                    of a double bridge over a canal and stream. At this point Mortar and artillery
                    fire was received. The first bridge was discovered intact but. blocked by logs.
                    2nd Lt. Peter Kostow dragged the logs away with his tank while under fire. The
                    second bridge was blown so the platoon continued looking for a crossing. Heavy
                    anti-tank fire eventually forced withdrawal, but not before it was determined
                    that a crossing could not be made without the help of the Engineers. The
                    Battalion Commander moved his advance Command Post to the underpass and received
                    artillery fire in the area throughout the day. While the above moves were being
                    made by the platoon of &quot; C &quot; Company, Lieutenant Hines, with a
                    reconnaissance platoon of &quot; C &quot; Company, was sent to the forward
                    Command Post. The platoon commanded by Lt. Delaney with the scout section of the
                    Reconnaissance platoon and a platoon of infantry was sent to find a southern
                    crossing to the objective. A crossing was found at Overhouen and the platoon
                    crossed and proceeded north along the trail to Millen. The bridge just south of
                    this town was found intact and the attack continued. A force of infantry just
                    south of town was encountered dug-in. Fire was laid on them and they
                    surrendered. The force continued through town and blocked all roads leading into
                    town. Additional Germans were killed and captured. The Battalion Commander
                    ordered the rest of the Battalion forward. Major Batchelder was bringing the
                    remainder of the Battalion forward when he was pinned down by direct fire from a
                    self propelled gun located on high ground. This fire was neutralized by one
                    section of the 2nd platoon, Company &quot; I &quot;, 67th Armored Regiment which
                    was holding the underpass and one section of the 1st platoon, Company &quot; I
                    &quot;, 67th which was in the main body. These tanks continued to fire until the
                    entire column passed. Captain Paul A. Bane was evacuated to the hospital during
                    the day and Lt. Harry S. Wood assumed command of Company &quot; I &quot;, 67th
                    Armored Regiment. The total number of prisoners captured was 70; the number
                    killed was large but the exact number is unknown. During the day, Lt. Reed, with
                    his Engineer platoon, was reattached to the Battalion. He contributed an
                    alternate bridge just south of the bridge into Millen. During the night this
                    platoon fired on an enemy patrol and captured one prisoner. Two other prisoners
                    were captured at road blocks during the night and another German was killed. The
                    line was held from Millen to contact point with the 82nd Reconnaissance.
                    Reconnaissance patrols were made during the night to contact road blocks to the
                    west of the Battalion Command Post location. Next morning at 07.00 hours, orders
                    were received from higher headquarters that the Battalion would be relieved by
                    the 744th Tank Battalion and upon its arrival the Battalion was to move to the
                    Combat Command &quot; R &quot; assembly area 5 miles northeast of Maastricht, A
                    meeting of commanding officers was held at the Battalion Command Post at 03.30
                    hours at which orders were issued for the march to the assembly area. The order
                    of march as given was: Reconnaissance platoon, platoon from &quot; I &quot;
                    Company, 41st Infantry, Battalion Headquarters and Headquarters Company,

                    march was made by way of Millen, Sittard, Geleen, Beek, Oensel, and Hulsberg
                    without incident. Upon arrival in assembly area, &quot; G &quot; Company
                    returned to battalion control and the 17th Engineer platoon and &quot; I &quot;

                <font face="Verdana">On 14 September 1944 We departed present location 1 mile
                    N. of Gruitode and the company mission was to move south with &quot;D&quot;
                    company attached, creating a diversion on the north flank of the company,
                    clearing out Opglabbeek and Opoetern, cutting the road between those points and
                    if possible cutting the main road running east and west between Asch and Willems
                    canal. The Battalion Executive Officer Major Jack Gerard (AKA &quot;The
                    Mole&quot;) remained at the road block. The 1st and the 2nd platoons each with a
                    tank platoon attached moved east through Neerglabeek, running into a road block
                    approximately 1 kilometer east of that point. The 2nd platoon remained to reduce
                    or bypass the road block and then move into Opoetern. The 1st platoon with
                    attached tanks moved cross country through the forest and arrived in Opoetern.
                    The 2nd platoon arrived at Opoetern first , having removed the road block which
                    proved to be lightly defended by small arms fire. The 2nd Platoon with the tank
                    platoon attached met resistance in the form of small arms fire at Opoetern. They
                    inflicted probably a dozen casualties and took a few prisoners. The first
                    platoon assisted in closing in on the town and taking some prisoners. At this
                    point, artillery began to fall in the town and the platoon withdrew. The 1st
                    platoon moved around the town to the right to continue its mission and to cut
                    off the road leading into the town. In a large open lowland west of the town ,
                    the 1st platoon encountered the enemy dug in and well camouflaged fox holes. The
                    enemy had a number of machines guns and bazookas and the personnel made of
                    approximately one third paratroopers and the remainder air force, they fought
                    quite well. Most of the men were killed in their holes by 75 mm WP smoke and
                    hand grenades. There were 23 known to be killed and four wounded. 40 prisoners
                    were taken in this locality. The tank platoon which had remained with the other
                    tank platoon during this action, rejoined the 1st platoon and they consolidated
                    their position to hold the town and the road net. Our 2nd platoon, and the
                    attached tank platoon returned to Gruitrode. The 3rd platoon moved around the
                    road block and into Opglabbeek, where they encountered a small enemy patrol
                    which withdrew. The platoon moved east to Dorne. The 2nd platoon pushed through
                    the forest to within 2 kilometers of the main highway running east from Asch.
                    Here we dismounted and in a spread out formation, we cautiously proceeded to the
                    highway on foot. Traveled five miles and arrived present location at Belgium,

                    of Dorne. The company mission was to locate the enemy west of the canal,
                    establish outpost to keep the canal under observation, maintain contact with the
                    British or the Princess Eugenia Regiment of the Dutch army attached to the
                    British Army, and to patrol the area from the highway to the east out of Asch,
                    the 1st British position which could usually be found around Bree about 18
                    kilometers to the north, The 2nd platoon maintained contact with the British and
                    establish outposts near Oppites and in the woods near Waterloos. These outposts
                    were frequently shelled and on three occasions our patrols encountered enemy
                    patrols in the Waterloos and inflicted casualties The enemy could be observed
                    across the canal near Tongerloo. The enemy destroyed by shell fire the church
                    steeples in Oppites and in Waterloos which we had been using as outposts. The
                    3rd platoon was located down the road toward the canal near De Smets Berg. From
                    an outpost there , the Germans could be seen on the west side of the canal near
                    the blown bridge in considerable strength of at least 250 or more men. As the
                    roads which might have been used to flank them were either mined or exposed to
                    direct fire of artillery and 88 mm guns from across the canal and the terrain
                    was not suitable for cross country movement, there was little that 3rd platoon
                    could do. The enemy frequently fired his mortars and artillery at positions that
                    he thought were being occupied. The enemy also fired air bursts over the platoon
                    position with 88 mm guns. Later in the day this platoon engaged the enemy in a
                    gun fight. Co. D had been attached and left the company that morning. Today we
                    captured 20 German prisoners. Weather clear and warm, morale excellent. Remained

                    had were put in a battery. The assault were directed from outpost about 1000

                    outpost near De Smets Berg these guns harassed the main group of the enemy about
                    1000 yards southeast of De Smets Berg. They also fired on the foot bridges over
                    the canal, on the ferry and at any targets of opportunity seen by the outposts.

                <font face="Verdana">By the evening of 15 Sept. 1944 the XIX Corps
                    had established a bridgehead on the east bank of the Meuse River in the vicinity
                    of Maastricht ( Holland ). Both the 30th Inf. Div. and CC&quot;A&quot; of the
                    2nd AD. had moved into the bridgehead ;and were ready to advance east. The 30th
                    Div. had the mission of giving flank protection to the VII Corps, whose attack
                    in the vicinity of Aachen constituted the current main effort of FUSA. The 2nd
                    Armored mission was to protect the area west of the Vaart Canal and CC
                    &quot;B&quot; had begun to advance in zone east of the Meuse River. Between the
                    Vaart Canal and the Meuse River, however lay a narrow corridor, extending
                    halfway across the XIX Corps front and completely in enemy hands. Obviously,
                    this had to be cleared out before the 2nd AD, could with safety continue its
                    advance east of the Meuse. XIX Corps FO # 24 of Map. #152340 Sept. 44 ordered
                    the 2nd AD to clear the enemy from this corridor. At 16 0500 Sept. 44 the
                    mission was turned over to Lt. Col.Wm. M. Stokes, Jr., then commanding the North
                    Force of CC &quot;A&quot;, 2 AD. At the time its force had the mission of
                    securing the XIX Corps boundary on the north and the Div. front along Vaart
                    Canal. It consisted of the following HQ., 66 AR, --3rd Bn, 66th AR--99th
                    Infantry Battalion ( Norwegians )--65th FA, Bn. ---Platoon of Co. A, 17th Eng.
                    --Detachment of Co. A, 48th Med. Bn. To help Col. Stokes with his additional
                    assignment, he was given 82nd Reconnaissance Bn. and Co B, 17 Armored Engr Bn.
                    Task Force &quot;Stokes,&quot; as the combined force was called, completely
                    cleared this critical corridor on 16, 17, and 18 September. During this 3-day
                    period it caused 918 enemy casualties and suffered only 93 casualties itself.
                    The success of the operation was due to sound planning, good field tactics,
                    unusually fine cooperation between tanks and infantry. Both tank and infantry
                    commanders agreed on this point.</font>

            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">The first pre-requisite was a complete reconnaissance of
                    the Vaart Canal for possible crossing sites. Most of it had already been
                    reconnoitered. The job was completed on the morning of 16 September. It showed
                    that between Maastricht and the north boundary of the Corps there were two
                    bridges left. A wooden one at Smeermaas (immediately north of Maastricht) was
                    capable of supporting tanks. The other one at Neerharen had been partially
                    wrecked by the enemy. Infantry in a single file could get across it, but major
                    repairs would be necessary if vehicles were to use it. Col. Stokes felt that
                    although he could put tanks across the Smeermaas bridge and thus give the
                    infantry some support from the very beginning, he could not depend on this
                    bridge for his MRS. Its wooden construction made it very vulnerable to
                    destruction either by bombs or demolition charges. Furthermore, it was in the
                    middle of a closely built up town and hence, in Col Stokes’ opinion, presented
                    an easy mark for saboteurs. The repair of the bridge at Neerharen would have
                    been very hazardous in view of enemy’s ability to observe all movement in its
                    vicinity from the high ground east of the Meuse River. Col Stokes concluded that
                    he would have to install a bridge for his MRS either at Reckheim or further
                    north. He considered three possible plans of action: (1) bridge canal at
                    Reckheim and work north up the corridor; (2) bridge canal in vic of Lanklaer and
                    advance south to Maastricht; (3) bridge canal in the center of the corridor and
                    work part of his TF north and part south. Col Stokes chose the first alternative
                    because (1) it meant that he would have friendly troops in his rear instead of
                    hostile forces in unknown strength; (2) he could bring small force up from
                    Smeermaas to establish a bridgehead east of the canal
                    for the crossing of the bulk of the infantry at Neerharen, and the enlarged
                    force could make a bridgehead in vicinity of Reckheim large enough for a tank Bn
                    to maneuver in; (3) a crossing at the center of the corridor would have forced
                    him to fight two ways at the same time, permitted the enemy to bring tanks and
                    AT weapons within close range of the crossing site (note narrowness of corridor

                <font face="Verdana">The decision to employ tanks&nbsp; in attacking up the
                    corridor was based on the following considerations: (1) tanks were available;
                    (2) speedy accomplishment of the mission was essential; (3) the enemy had had
                    sufficient time to prepare hasty field positions; (4) the enemy was believed to
                    be holding the corridor in considerable strength, with 500 troops reported to
                    have crossed on to the corridor at Boorsheim on 13 Sept and 500 SS troops
                    reported to have recently reinforced the Meeswyck area. No information on the
                    presence or absence of AT weapons was available, with the exception that
                    reconnaissance had failed to disclose any enemy in the narrow part of the
                    corridor at Smeermaas and for 1km north thereof. North of this point the enemy’s
                    defenses were unknown except for dug-in MG positions on the reverse slope of the
                    east bank of the canal all the way to Lanklaer. Since the corridor varied from
                    30 to 250 meters wide for another two kms, it was obviously unwise to send any
                    large tank force across the wooden bridge at Smeermaas.</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">As a result of this decision, Col. Stokes felt there were
                    two distinct phases to the reduction of the corridor: (1) the establishment of a
                    bridgehead across Reckheim, which would have to be an infantry job primarily,
                    and (2) the attack north of Lanklaer. The latter would have to move fast to
                    prevent hostile reinforcements coming onto the corridor, particularly at the
                    narrow neck in the center; hence, it would have to be primarily a tank attack.
                    Following this reasoning, the tanks taking part in the attack on the 16 and 17
                    of Sept were attached to the 99th Inf Bn; whereas on 18 Sept most of the 99th
                    Inf Bn (Companies A and C) were attached to the 3d Bn, 66 A. R.. As it turned
                    out, this made little difference in the way in which
                    the chain of command actually operated. During the first two days of the
                    operation Col. Stokes sent most of his communications to Maj Harold D. Hansen,
                    CO of 99th Inf Bn, through Lt Henry W. Johnson, CO of Co H, 66 A. R. Lt Johnson
                    relates that Maj Hansen was dismounted after the first 15 minutes; that he did
                    not see him again during the operation; that his (Johnson’s ) orders came from
                    Col Stokes; and that in practice he communicated directly with his platoon
                    leaders and they in turn with the infantry platoon leaders. On this point Major
                    Hansen said that communications were very difficult throughout the operation and
                    that messengers had to be used much of time. But he emphasized that Col Stokes
                    &quot;did not try to run the infantry. He is a tanker. He asked for my
                    recommendations on the use of the infantry.&quot;</font>

                <font face="Verdana">About 161700 September the 2d platoon (5 M-4’s) of Company H,
                    66 A. R. , the 2d platoon ( 5 M-5’s) of Company B, 66 A. R., and all of
                    Company C, 99th Inf. Bn, crossed the Vaart Canal on the wooden bridge at
                    Smeermaas. Captain Herbert C. Merlin, CO of Company C, had made no specific
                    arrangements with the tank platoon leaders regarding tank-infantry tactics. The
                    99th Inf. Bn had worked with the 3/66f AR for or three days prior to
                    this&nbsp;operation, and it was mutually understood that the infantry would be
                    assigned to work with specific tanks. This was done. About 5 doughboys were
                    assigned to each light tank and about 8 to each medium. The spearhead of
                    TF&quot;S&quot; moved north in column, led by the light tanks. It met an outpost
                    screen about one km north of the bridge but progressed almost to the bridge at
                    Neerharen before meeting any resistance of consequence. More hostile force had
                    concentrated in some woods. To clean it out, the tanks deployed, the lights
                    mixed with the mediums, and the infantry dismounted. While the infantry
                    protected the tanks from possible bazooka fire, the tanks took care of any
                    hostile automatic fire that opened up. Resistance soon faded, but rear guards
                    enabled a lot of Germans to get away. Near the Neerharen bridge the enemy
                    occupied a pillbox. The tanks plastered it with 75 mm fire. This kept the
                    defenders from manning their weapons and stunned them. After that the infantry
                    had little trouble in capturing most of the occupants and killing a few who
                    still showed signs of resisting. When the spearhead force had secured the east
                    side of the Canal at this point, the rest of the 99th Inf Bn (-1 platoon of
                    company A), then assembled vicinity Neerharen, prepared to cross over. At this
                    point the infantry was subjected to a 20 minutes concentration of hostile
                    artillery, estimated to have been at least one battery of medium artillery. From
                    the&nbsp; high ground east of the Meuse River the enemy had direct observation.
                    To avoid bringing down a concentration on the bridge itself, it was necessary to
                    rush the troops across a few at the time. The situation required leadership. For
                    example, the 1st platoon of B Company was pinned down after suffering 4
                    casualties. T/Sgt Roland I. Asleson, the platoon leader, demonstrated
                    outstanding leadership in rallying his platoon and getting them across the
                    bridge.</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">It was now about 1900.&nbsp; Major Hansen realized that
                    the important thing was to get his force north out of the narrowest part of the
                    corridor before dark. Fortunately, no AT weapons were encountered, only some
                    foxholes along the east bank of the Canal, which were facing west. The tanks
                    rolled up and pasted these positions with 75mm and MG fire. When they lifted
                    their fire, the infantry advanced and took TF Stokes’ first large bunch of PWs.
                    The CO of B Co, Lt Gunderson, was injured late in the day and had to be
                    evacuated. Lt Murton Swenson became the company commander. By 2100 the troops
                    had advanced into the broad part of the corridor and secured an outpost line
                    stretching across it. The tanks were deployed inside the bivouac areas of the
                    companies they work with (see attached overlay for positions).</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">The next morning Major Hansen attacked at 0530 with
                    company C on the left and company B&nbsp; on the right. Company A was kept in
                    reserve, as it was short one platoon that was guarding the west bank of the
                    Vaart Canal. The tank-infantry teams consisted of about one squad to a tank.
                    Just as the troops were preparing to attack, the enemy opened up with fire from
                    a stone wall or dike that ran at an angle across the corridor. This caused some delay, but then
                    a mist developed, and under its cover the
                    tanks followed by the infantry, advanced right up to the wall, receiving only
                    inaccurate, sporadic fire.&nbsp; The enemy had fled. The tanks now turn left and
                    go west nearly to the Canal in order to get around the wall. The infantry swung
                    right and advanced northeast with troops on both sides of the wall. When they
                    reached a woods in the vicinity of the road to Reckheim, they waited for the
                    tanks to rejoin them, as Major Hansen felt that a combined tank-infantry attack
                    on the woods would be the cheapest way to reduce them. The tanks arrived after
                    about an hour and the woods were overrun without difficulty.</font>

            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">There were three main fights on 17 September: at Uykhoven,
                    Boorsheim, and Cothem. At Uykhoven TF Stokes hit its really stubborn resistance,
                    which came from young GAF troops. Presumably by friendly artillery. All of the
                    enemy’s prepared positions faced west.&nbsp; Our tanks and infantry flanked
                    these positions by attacking from the south and overwhelmed the defenders by
                    volume of their firepower. A considerable quantity of material was captured at
                    Uykhoven.</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">The rest of Company H, 66 A. R. , and its CO, Lt Johnson,
                    now joined the task force, having crossed the canal at Smeermaas about 1000.
                    Their arrival was tremendous help. The two infantry company commanders were
                    enable to assign all their men to specific tanks, whereas previously there had
                    not been enough tanks to go around. Their arrival also made possible a
                    well-conceived maneuver whereby Boorsheim, Cothem, and the &quot;neck&quot; of
                    the corridor were secured simultaneously. B Company (-1 platoon) of the 99th Inf
                    Bn, and a platoon of H Company, 66 A. R., were sent to Cothem. C Company 99th
                    Inf Bn, and H Company (-1 platoon), 66 A. R., helf positions east of Boorsheim,
                    while the platoon of light tanks and the remaining rifle platoon of B Company
                    started to clean Boorsheim. When the two towns were about half cleaned out, C
                    Company, 99th Inf Bn, and H Company (-), 66 A. R., hit straight for the corridor’s
                    &quot;neck&quot; (just east of Mechelen) and secured it with little
                    difficulty. Control of this neck by the hostile forces that might have retreated
                    to it from Boorsheim would have held up our advance and cost us dearly to force
                    a passageway. About 100 PWs were taken in Boorsheim and about 150 at Cothem.
                    Cothem was the harder fight, as there were more troops there and they were
                    protected by fires from across the bend in the Meuse River. A few did escape in
                    boats across the Meuse, but most fought as long as they could and then&nbsp;
                    surrendered. Prisoners were still being gathered in from this area the next
                    morning.</font>

            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">During this time the 246 Engr C Bn. having floated
                    sections of a heavy pontoon bridge down the Canal as far as possible on the
                    night of 16 - 17 September, went to work as soon as the bridgehead east of
                    Reckheim was secured. They moved the section into place and completed the bridge
                    by 1330, approximately three hours after the securing of the bridgehead. The
                    rest of the 3d Bn, 66 A. R., then proceeded across the bridge.</font>

                <font face="Verdana">While Boorsheim and Cothem were being cleaned out, C
                    Company of the 99th Inf Bn and H Company (-) of 66 A. R. secured a line south of
                    the dike that goes across the corridor at Vucht. Company A was brought up to tie
                    in on the right of C for the night. Company H, 66 A. R., bivouacked in the vic,
                    as did Company G, which had crossed the tread way bridge at Reckheim about 1600,
                    along with the rest of 3/66 A. R. B Company (99 Inf. ) and the light tanks out
                    posted critical areas at the &quot;neck&quot; and south thereof that night and
                    the next day (see attached overlay). The narrowness of the corridor made this a
                    necessary precaution against a hostile attempt to interfere with the line of
                    communications and/or the new bridge at Reckheim. B company was given the
                    assignment because, according to Major Hansen, it had taken quite a few
                    casualties in the hard fighting from Daeluykhoven trough Cothem, while Company A
                    was fresh. Company A, however, was short one rifle platoon, and Lt Swenson of B
                    Company speaks of only 16 casualties in his company during the operation.</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">On the third day of the operation, 18 September, Companies
                    A and C of 20 M-4’s took up positions northeast of
                    the towns, five M-4’s approached the towns from the south and shot up
                    everything in sight. The infantry - Company C and the platoon from Company A -
                    then cleaned out most of the area. The infantry were unable to clean out the
                    town completely in the time allotted to do this job. Col Stokes was pressing his
                    subordinate commanders to get to Lanklaer, and the infantry were called away
                    before they could finish the job.* Belgian resistance groups gathered close to
                    100 additional PWs from the vic of Eysden after T. F Stokes had gone on to
                    Lanklaer. Some of the hostile defenders were paratroopers. They retreated to the
                    north, only to encounter fire from the 20 tanks waiting for them. On the
                    northern outskirts of Eysden they put up a stubborn fight. They could not
                    escape. They would not surrender. Most of them were killed in their holes.</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">The rifle platoon of Company A now rejoined Major Zeien’s
                    force, though not the eight tanks of G Company. This gave Zeien five M-4’s and
                    about 65 infantrymen (both Company G and Company A were under T/O strength).
                    Major Zeien put all the riflemen on the tanks - it came to about eight on each
                    tank - and set out to reduce about seven square Kms on the east side of the
                    corridor. Fortunately, resistance turned out to be extremely light until the
                    force approached Stockheim. There the infantry dismounted and Major Zeien’s
                    force collaborated with Major O’Farrell’s force in reducing the strongest
                    resistance encountered during the entire three-day operation.</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">Major O’Farrell’s force had advanced north from Eysden
                    astride the Eysden-Lanklaer road. One platoon of tanks and a platoon of infantry
                    worked on the west side of the road, and the balance was in two columns east of
                    the road. No resistance was met until the force drew near Lanklaer. There,
                    approximately 300 yards south of the Lankaer-Stockheim road, the enemy had
                    recently dug a line of trenches. They were the first hostile positions
                    encountered which faced south. Though expertly camouflaged, they were not
                    completely finished.</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">* Capt Donald E. Svarstad, CO of A company, says that the
                    reason C Company suffered heavier casualties than A Company on 18 Sep
                    (approximately 40 against 12) was that Major O’ Farrell’s tanks were in such
                    a hurry to get on that they left the infantry behind in places. The mopping up
                    by Major Zeien’s force was slower, but more thorough and caused less
                    casualties.</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">The positions were supported by two SP 88’s close to the
                    road. These were the first AT weapons encountered by TF Stokes. While the bilk
                    of Major O’ Farrell’s group was getting into position to attack the enemy
                    line, the left column tried to outflank the enemy on the west. No satisfactory
                    route of attack could be found, so the column retraced its steps and started to
                    cross the road separating it from the rest of the group. As it did so, it came
                    into the field of fire of a 47mm AT gun at the main intersection in Lanklaer. At
                    a range of about 800 meters, the AT gun was knocked out by 75mm fire, and the
                    column proceeded safely across the road.</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">At about the same time other tanks of Company H, 66 A R,
                    spotted the two SP 88’s and went after them. One of the two had not yet gotten
                    into position and was an easy mark. The other for some reason did not get off a
                    round before it, too was put out of action. This left the Germans manning the
                    trenches without any AT protection except for three direct fire guns, of
                    approximately 75 mm caliber, which were &quot;dug in&quot; (i.e., firing in
                    stationary positions) about on km northeast of Lanklaer. These were well hidden
                    by a grove of trees, and either for this reason or because it was raining, or
                    both, neither the artillery FO nor the AOP could spot the guns. Fortunately,
                    however, most of the rounds from these guns detonated on striking tree branches,
                    and the shots that did come through were wild. Company H did not have one
                    casualty from this fire, and one of the three guns was eventually knocked out
                    somehow.</font>

                <font face="Verdana">Major Zeien’s force arrived about 1615 - approximately
                    45 minutes after Major O’Farrell had reached the vicinity. The two forces
                    attacked the enemy dug-in positions in their respective sectors, the tanks
                    spearheading the attack. The German troops were from the 22d Flieger Regt. Most
                    of them were young and fought to the bitter end. In many cases they remained in
                    their trenches even after the tanks came right up to them, and it was sometimes
                    necessary to get them out by WP grenades and by pistol fire from tank turrets.
                    During this action on 18 September Lt George Heald, a platoon leader of Company
                    A, 99th Inf. Bn, accounted for four bazooka men, thus
                    saving the tank with which his platoon was working. Four of the platoon members,
                    however, were wounded by a fifth German. Lt Heald was in a position to get this
                    man also, but his carbine jammed.</font>

                <font face="Verdana">After the trenches were captured, the tanks crossed the
                    Lankaer-Stockheim road and Major O’Farrell’s tanks fanned west to cut off
                    any enemy retreating from Lankaer, while his infantry and a few tanks went into
                    town from the south and east. Major Zeien’s force went clockwise around
                    Stockheim, setting up road blocks at every road leading out of town (see
                    attached overlay for routes of advance). Then a small force went into town and
                    found it virtually deserted. Lanklaer did not fall so easily. Additional
                    paratroopers were there, and both in and on the western outskirts of the town
                    they fought stubbornly until they were killed. By 1730 all resistance had ceased
                    and the line Lanklaer-Stockheim secured.</font>

                <font face="Verdana">Lt Col Stokes, Major O’ Farrell, Major Hansen, and all
                    of the tank and infantry company commanders involved in operation of TF Stokes
                    are in agreement that the use of armor was the key factor in speed with which
                    the mission was accomplished and the disproportionate number of casualties
                    suffered by the enemy. Lt col Stokes says, &quot;The enemy was very much
                    surprised at our use of tanks. When the attack began in the late afternoon of 16
                    September, he had no AT weapons in the corridor. Not until the end of the third
                    day - around Lanklaer - did we hit anything bigger than a bazooka.&quot;</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">Major O’ Farrell said: &quot;The infantry took a good
                    many casualties (see tabulation below). But by themselves the doughboys would
                    have a terrible time. The krauts had a hell of a lot of automatic fire and the
                    defense was extremely stubborn.&quot;</font>
            </p>
            <p>
                <font face="Verdana">Major Hansen emphasized the fast advance which the
                    presence of the tanks made possible. The Germans, he felt had no time to prepare
                    their defenses. &quot;They had plenty of ammunition - they were burning piles of
                    it as we came up to Uykhoven - but they had no heavy weapons in the corridor.
                    Those at Lanklaer had been brought down from Maseyck
                    to stop us. Then, too, our tankers were good. For example, when someone pointed
                    out the AT guns at Lanklaer, they went right out after them and knocked them
                    out. We picked up 75 or 80 prisoners afterwards in the rear areas. They said,
                    &quot;We can't fight tanks.&quot; I am sure that is what scared them. It was a
                    tougher fight than Elbeuf for us, but without the tanks it would have taken a
                    long time to clean that corridor. . . . The tanks are only afraid of places like
                    buildings and hedges where bazooka men can hide without being seen. If the tanks
                    are working with infantry who are not afraid to stay up with the tanks, the
                    combination can't be beat. Of course, the infantry think tanks should always
                    go ahead and often have to be booted.&quot;</font>

                <font face="Verdana">Tank-infantry teamwork. The tank commanders and infantry
                    commanders interviewed tended to emphasize the work of their respective arms.
                    There was no basic conflict, however, as to what generally happened: Each group
                    of infantry followed wherever its assigned tank went; except that&nbsp; the
                    tanks got stuck at a stream or dike, Major Hansen would order the infantry
                    advance without the tanks to a designated objective. In other words, the
                    infantry advanced and cleaned out objectives in the immediate wake of the tanks.</font>
