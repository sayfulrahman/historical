        <font face="Verdana">Written By: Carl A. Wood, a member of
            Co. A., 82<sup>nd</sup> Reconnaissance Battalion, Company A, 2<sup>nd</sup>
            Armored Division in World War 2.</font>

<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Wow! Being asked to write about my experiences with the 2<sup>nd</sup>
        Armored Division can be difficult. Putting about 3 years into a few pages about
        something that happened so long ago. I just hope that I am up the challenge.
        Before I was assigned to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored. I spent about 6 months at
        Ft. Knox and Ft. Campbell, Kentucky before shipping out from Ft. Kilmer, New
        Jersey. What I learned at Ft. Knox was how to assemble weapons, drive a jeep
        through mud knee deep, they never got stuck, crawl on my stomach, somebody could
        fire 30 caliber machine guns 6 to 12 inches over me and the greatest of all
        saluting a 90 day wonder. Everyone knows who they were.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">After all that I was shipped out to North Africa, was in a
        replacement depot for about a week, seemed like years, then I was assigned to A
        Company of the 82<sup>nd</sup> Armored Reconnaissance Battalion. Was there for
        about 3 or 4 months, while there I met a lot of real fine men, we had a company
        commander, a man in his fifties, an ex-marine, and he though he was far superior
        to a common army man. However, I will never forget one incident that we all
        enjoyed. As one of our daily &quot;chores&quot; we were having inspection, the
        Company Commander took the rifle of a corporal, (can’t remember his name)
        inspected it, handed back to the corporal, corporal wouldn’t take it, after
        trying to get the corporal to take the rifle three or four times, he said,
        &quot;Corporal why won’t you take this weapon&quot;, corporal replied
        &quot;Its not the way I gave it to you sir&quot;, the bolt was not pulled back,
        which was required when you give the rifle for inspection. The bolt was pulled
        back, the rifle was handed to the corporal and a red faced Captain moved on down
        the line.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Nothing of consequence really happened while in North
        Africa, we were bivouacked in a field close to Oran, made it into Oran one time
        , which was enough. Slept in pup tents after we made sure the tarantulas were
        gone, bathed in water heated in 50 gallon drums during the day, swam in the
        Mediterranean Sea, also known as &quot;The Sea in the Middle of the Land &quot;,
        pulled guard duty and all the other duties, like KP etc. When we left we were
        required to leave the area the way it was. As we were leaving I can remember
        seeing Arabs digging up the area we left hoping to find something of value.
        Where they come from I don’t know.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">In the meantime, the Sicilian campaign had started. A
        Company was held in reserve, when the battle for Sicily ended we were sent there
        to pull MP (military police) duty. We shipped out from Bizerte and landed in
        Palermo, Sicily. While in Palermo we had Italian prisoners that waited on us
        hand and foot, did our cleaning, our laundry, anything that came along, they
        were more than pleased to do all of these things for us as they were fed well,
        and treated well, also the war was over for them. We were ordered to out post a
        radio tower and believe it or not I listened to the World Series. Being a St.
        Louis Cardinal fan, I couldn’t have asked for more and they won the world
        series.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Stationed in Sicily until November , 1943, we left for
        England , on the water 20 to 25 days, about all we did was eat, exercise, play
        cards; and some of the men fed the fish. When we reached the United Kingdom we
        were stationed at Tidworth Barracks on the Salisbury Plain. While there we never
        knew what it was to sleep, they certainly put us through the paces, everyone
        said they were getting us ready for the kill. Most all of us had appetites out
        of this world. I went from 150 pounds to 190, didn’t take long to lose it
        after we got to France. I had one furlough in the 3 years I was with Uncle Sam.
        Took that in London with a friend , McMahon from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area.
        Mac never made it home. Lost his life when we were in the Bulge. I think the
        same time Sgt. Emery L. Jeffares lost a finger, I’ll never forget he said!
        &quot;I’m on my way home&quot;. His home was Georgia. If my memory serves me
        right, he thought Dinah Shore was &quot;IT&quot;.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">After about six months, the dreaded day came. They claimed
        they would darkened the skies with our planes they almost did. I have never seen
        so many planes in the air at one time, how the Germans lived through that I’ll
        never know, but they did. Our company landed on D + 4, can remember riding off
        of the LST into deep water up in the Jeep, but it was waterproofed good and we
        made it to the bank without any problems. Earl McCullough was the driver, Sgt.
        Albert Carver operated a 30 caliber machine gun and I had a BAR gun (Browning
        Automatic rifle). One of the first things I saw was 2 German soldiers sitting
        upright in a vehicle larger than jeeps with no faces. It was nothing but pulp.
        Looked like a GI had taken a machine gun and pulverized them.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">We were sent on patrol immediately, we were all very
        nervous &quot;putting it mildly&quot;, but we had 3 days and nights of hell. Its
        hard to remember the order of things but Lt. Thomas ( a fine man) was killed by
        a land mine, the road we were on , the Germans had zeroed in on with air burst
        and they were good at it. After the three days we were &quot;pulled back&quot;
        to get a little rest. Being a private I had the &quot;privilege&quot; of pulling
        guard duty. While on guard, I heard the sound of soldiers marching, I hit the
        ground, it was pitch dark, you couldn’t see anything, anyway a
        &quot;platoon&quot; of about 30 men marched right me. I don’t think I
        breathed. They were Germans. It was night our artillery was firing about 3
        fields over from where we were, remember the 5 to 6 acre fields with the
        hedgerows, anyway enemy planes came over and dropped their bombs, they hit the
        field between us and the artillery, but the smoke and dust covered the area;.
        After the planes gone it was very quiet except for picks and shovels. No one had
        dug in the night before as we felt we were OK away from the front line, at that
        time there was not really a front line. All we had done was covered our vehicles
        before we sacked out. The next morning there was not any fox holes as no one
        could see what they were doing. Should have got an &quot;E&quot; for effort
        though.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">I can’t recall whether this happened the same night or
        not but during the change of the guard. Private Duhon killed Sgt. Schaefer
        accidentally. Duhon almost went out of his mind over the incident and later lost
        his life. Near the same time we lost a tank .driver got out was seriously hurt,
        our medic , a Swedish man from Minnesota came to the rescue, his Red Cross arm
        band was in plain view and a German killed him with machine gun fire. I can’t
        remember any other details as everything was chaotic. I was still the third man
        in the jeep with Earl McCullough and Sgt. Carver, out on patrol several times,
        however one day Pvt. Robinson was in my place, out on patrol, he was killed.
        Earl McCullough and Carver were seriously injured, they never returned to the
        company. To this day I do not know why Robinson was in my place.. I guess it
        just wasn’t my time.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">After the St. Lo break through, we had the Germans on the
        run, we traveled through France and Belgium with only a few skirmishes. We did
        lose our platoon lieutenant and armored car driver, Robichaux. Robichaux was
        driving the armored car and the lieutenant was riding on the drivers side, if my
        memory serves me right , Swonger was walking on the other side of the armored
        car. The armored car was hit, flames flew into the air and I think the flames
        blinded the Germans so they could no see the other vehicles. They did more
        firing but did not hit anyone else. The recent pictures on Kosovo, reminded mo
        of our trek across France to Belgium. The people were so overjoyed to see us,
        they give us wine, liquor, flowers and the best kisses. They lined the roads and
        we enjoyed every minute of it. If the citizens weren’t out to greet us, you
        had to be very vary, Someone else was still around.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">We made it to the Netherlands ( Holland ) without too much
        difficulty, l can remember sleeping in a Dutch home, slept on the kitchen floor,
        open the kitchen door and there was the stable with the cows. The family had two
        daughters, probably in their late teens and very, very chubby. The odor from the
        stable was a little strong but being inside was great as it was terribly cold at
        that time.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Its so hard to remember the sequences of events but while
        we were in Holland, had a little encounter with the enemy, I think they were
        Dutch soldiers. I imagine Sgt. Euan Green and Sgt. McElwaney will remember this.
        We were in a field where there were two or three haystacks. One of our tank men,
        operated a 50 caliber machine, got shot. Sgt. Green and I went around one of the
        hay stacks, and their was a soldier with a grenade in his hand preparing to
        throw it at a tank. Sgt. Green hollered get down Carl, he had the presence of
        mind to have a hand grenade. When the soldier heard the voice he was startled ,
        didn’t throw his grenade but it and the one Sgt. Green had went off the same
        time in the fox hole he was in. Sgt. McElwaney and I got one out of another
        foxhole that our tank had fired on with a 75 MM , he came out , but could hardly
        walk, but we took him prisoner. I never knew how our 50 caliber machine operator
        mad out, he had been shot through he abdomen.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Seemed like a short time after that we were ordered to
        outpost a town near Aachen, Germany. We went through the village and as we got
        to the far side all &quot; Hell&quot; broke loose. I was driving the Company
        Commander at the time, we hit the ground as did everyone. Not one of us was hurt
        but a couple of cows were grazing right by at the time, l they were both killed.
        They shelled us incessantly, had flat tires on our vehicles, did fine some bales
        of hay that we put around the jeeps and armored cars. We held this town for 3 or
        4 days , our company Commander us to stay off of the main St. as the Germans
        were zeroed in on us. However he and the 3<sup>rd</sup> platoon lieutenant were
        apparently discussing something and absently walked around the corner of a
        building into the street. They were both injured very badly, I don’t know how
        they made out as we never saw them again, at the same time about 15 or 20 men (
        myself included ) had taken cover in a cellar entrance. I will never forget
        this, a huge piece of smoldering shrapnel slammed through the door, ripping it
        apart, came down the steps and never hit anyone, we were on both sides of the
        door against the wall, how lucky can you get. We were told the reason we were
        just to hold the town, was that our gasoline supplies were low and we had to
        hold for a time. I believe this is the time Capt. Hartford took command of the
        Company.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Anyway the Battle of the Bulge started shortly and we
        moved south, I think we lost more vehicles from the ice and snow than we did
        from the enemy the first day or two. In our moving south I recall seeing a field
        with many 7<sup>th</sup> Armored tanks that had been knocked out by the Germans.
        I guess that made an impression us, because I had a half brother in that
        division. He was not hurt and I saw him that day or the next.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">After the Battle of the Bulge it seems we drove across
        Germany without too much difficulty. We liberated a lot of English prisoners
        somewhere in Germany, they all wanted cigarettes, which we gave them. We tossed
        packages of cigarettes until we all run out. The prisoners seemed to be in real
        good health. I can remember we spotted an enemy plane, small reconnaissance
        type. After a lot of firing we knocked down the power lines. They were hot. The
        farmer came up the road , turned into his house, the horses he was driving
        stepped on the lines trembled and fell to the ground. I have often though that
        we were awfully lucky one of our vehicles didn’t drive across those lines. I
        have no idea where this happened , but it wasn’t long before we were in
        Magdeburg, Germany on the Elbe River. We stopped there , waited 2 weeks for the
        Russians, when they arrived, I met a Russian soldier ( oriental) . I put my hand
        out to shake with him , he had no idea what I was doing, he finally got the
        message and we shook hands. The Russian soldiers soon got paid, we were prepared
        for them. I sold a watch with a shining bracelet to one of them for $300.00.
        There was a lot of wheeling and dealing for about 2 weeks, then the Russian
        government refused to honor their currency .so after that we were allowed to
        send our pay home plus 10% or 15%. I &quot;guess&quot; American taxpayer
        absorbed the cost, anyway it was fun while it lasted.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">In a short time we were ordered to go to Berlin, were
        there until October, 1945 when I shipped out for the USA. While in Berlin it was
        &quot;spit and polish&quot;. The Potsdam Conference was held while we were
        there. Reviews were held for President Truman, Winston Churchill, Generals,
        Marshall, Eisenhower,, Bradley, Patton. . Preparing for one of the reviews , we
        had to take the armored cars to have them washed , after they were washed we
        were returning on the autobahn and Loren Guge was in charge, so he gave the sign
        to speed up , well we did, if I recall we cruising about; l50 miles per hour and
        met the battalion commander. Word was waiting for Guge when we returned .
        Everyone thought it was al lot of fun except Loren. He tells me , he doesn’t
        remember m but it happened, wasn’t long until October , 1945 rolled around an
        I left the division, shipped out from Antwerp, Belgium, came back through Camp
        Kilmer, N.J. Where I had shipped out from. It was great to be home. P.S. The 90
        day wonders turned out to be OK guys.</font>

<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Being on a troop train in Belgium, it was extremely cold,
        train stopped every mile or two. Why were we on a troop train, where were our
        vehicles? Does anyone make &quot;good&quot; coffee like we had then. That was
        the first coffee I had ever tasted but it was cold that anything warm would have
        been good. Those sanitary cans would have a hard time getting by the health
        department today.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">How we all loved the sight of our fighter planes. How we
        had to change the color of the panels we had put on our vehicles every day. How
        we goofed one time , got strafed by our own planes, thank goodness no one got
        hurt.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">We got served a Christmas dinner at the time of the Battle
        of the Bulge, was it the Red Cross or the Army: I know it sure tasted good.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">How the Germans changed the road signs at the Battle of
        the Bulge to foul us up. When we were being shelled with mortars in Germany and
        one of our tanks with a bulldozer on the front buried them alive. They were
        firing from a bunker so he just put the blade down and took care of the
        situation. The firing stopped.</font>

<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Sgt. Frederick Morse with A Company maintenance section.
        He is mentioned on Page 216 of the book &quot;Hell on Wheels &quot;. The 2<sup>nd</sup>
        Armored Division by Donald E. Houston. I was in A Company, but I don’t
        remember him. Captain Hartford is mentioned on page 265. He was a 1<sup>st</sup>
        Lieutenant then.</font>

<p>
    <font face="Verdana">The American plane (bomber) that was shot down when we
        were in Normandy: the plane split in too parts , several men parachuted out. It
        didn’t happen right over us but about ½ mile away.</font>

    <font face="Verdana">Bob Hope and Jerry Colonna entertained us in Berlin. If I
        remember right; he had a pretty girl or two along.</font>

<p>
    <font face="Verdana">The thee little children that took their hands and tried
