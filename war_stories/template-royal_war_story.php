    <h2 class="center">Our Last Obstacle</h2>

        Many of the stories have recounted the battles of war, but
        this one is my recollections of the human side of the war. The SS were ruthless
        bastards, but the older German people that I met had no faith in Hitler’s war.

        By mid April, of 1945, &quot;Hells on Wheels was advancing
        far out ahead of the other American forces. Our last obstacle was taking over
        Magdeburg and crossing the Elbe River. We had occupied a portion of the city,
        but the German forces were so strong that we could not advance any more. So the
        Commanding Officer sent a note to the General of the German forces and told him,
        that if he didn’t surrender the city, we would withdraw and the city would be
        bombed off the map. They refused to surrender. We withdrew and the bombing
        began. A steady stream of planes continued to bomb that city for 12 consecutive
        hours. Once the bombing stopped that night we entered the next morning. There
        was no connection to the city we had entered the day before and the one I
        entered the day after the bombing. We went down the city’s streets with hardly
        any resistance. And the Germans were right close because you could hear them
        walking on the sidewalks on the next block. They always had steel in their shoes
        so you could hear them walking from a long ways.

        When we would enter the cities the German people would
        scorn you, but when we would leave they would have tears in their eyes. Old
        German people would be sad because they didn’t know who would be coming in
        next. That was one thing about our generals they told us &quot;buddy you treat
        these people good.&quot; Some of them treated them like dogs. They stole from
        them. That’s one thing we didn’t do. We treated them nice. They would scorn
        you at first but a day or two later when you gave them food, were nice and sing
        with them, they would have tears in their eyes when you left. Because they got
        that attached to you. They didn’t know who was coming up next and feared what
        would happen to them. Especially if the Russians were coming in, they were bad
        to them. In Berlin, I can remember they told us many of the Germans committed
        suicide when they knew the Russians were entering the city. They didn’t want
        to give up to the Russians. The Germans would rather kill themselves.

        I think it was on the second night of guard duty a German
        woman came and tapped me on the arm and invited me into her house to get out of
        the rain and cold. I was leaning against a big thick doorway with my rifle in my
        hand and when she touch me on my shoulder I swung around with that rifle. Here
        was this old German lady speaking and I could understand German pretty good by
        this time. So I knew what she was talking about &quot;inviting me in to get out
        of this cold.&quot; It was rainy and cold. It wasn’t good. So I told her I was
        on guard duty and I couldn’t come in then, but that when I got off I might
        come in. So later I woke the next guy for duty and decided to go in the house.
        All the second floor of this house was blown out but the first floor wasn’t. I
        walked through an entry and into the dining room. There was a round table all
        cleaned off with a steel beam right through the middle of it. It was a 12&quot;
        steel I-beam that during the bombing had flown through the air, came down the
        roof, second floor and through the dining room table clear through to the
        basement. No one in the family was hurt. But the couple had to live in the
        basement. As soon as I went in the door, the German woman asked her husband if
        she could give me a small piece of bread. They just had this small piece of
        bread left in the house. Her husband said it would be all right and she cut a
        small little square from the piece for me. I wasn’t actually hungry, but I ate
        it so that she wouldn’t feel bad. Then a few minutes later she asked her
        husband if she could give me this little bit of cognac that they had in a cedar
        chest. He told her that was all right too, so I drank that damn thing. My buddy
        and I then stayed in the shot out second floor that at least kept us in out of
        the rain.

        A few days later we borrowed an amphibious jeep that we
        drove to a stocked German army warehouse that stood just west of the Elbe River.
        We wanted to retrieve food for that old German couple that had been so kind to
        us. As we went around the front of the building the Germans began firing at us
        from across the river. So we slipped around the rear of the warehouse broke out
        a window and backed the jeep to the window. We made off with cases of canned
        goods that we took back and stacked in the old German couple’s empty kitchen.
        I’ll never forget the tears of gratitude streaming down that old German lady’s
        face.
