        Continued...</font>

<p>
    <font face="Verdana">We were most of the time behind the main line of attack in
        enemy territory, and would have had a lot of problems if we were not clearly
        marked for our planes to plainly see that we were friendly troops. From 13 June
        1944 until 1 July 1944 we remained same location, running patrols to contact
        friendly troops, and doing maintenance on all equipment, cleaning our weapons
        that we were to carry into combat. Our map information, read as follows-France
        1/50.000 GSGS,#1,250, St. Lo sheet: #T672742. l July, 1944 we moved about 7
        miles, location number GSGS, #4250 to set up a Division command post, it was
        rainy, morale excellent. On the 14 July 1944 the platoons assault gun crews were
        sent to the vicinity of Caumont, France to train in firing their assault guns as
        a battery.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Now location about two miles W. at St. Paul Du Vernay,
        France. using the new sheet map location of St. Lo. #T725703. On 17 July 1944
        the assault guns returned to the company at 1530A. On 18 July 1944 the company
        moved to GSGS, #4250, #6 F/2, St. Lo map sheet: # T 627764 which was a distance
        of 12 miles, and was 3/4 of a mile NE of Tournieres, France Weather was clear,
        morale excellent. On the 20 July 1944, weather cloudy, did maintenance. On the
        21 of July 1944 we were alerted to move out, weather rainy. Then on the 22 July
        1944 we were alerted to to be ready for combat mission. That night laying awake
        in my bed roll looking up at the stars and listening to the distance artillery
        firing in the distance, I had these thoughts. Here I was a young recruit, and I
        was trained, but I had never heard a hostile gun until a few weeks ago. I
        wondered, why did I volunteer? There was only one way to go here and that was
        forward. A good many men when they hear of war from a distance claim to be
        anxious to get into the battle. When they say so they generally fail to convince
        the people listening that they are as anxious as they would make you believe, as
        they approach the actual danger they become more subdued. This is not a
        universal rule, but I have known men who were always ready to fight when there
        was not an enemy in sight, and then there were some as good as there word when
        the fighting began. But the amount of men that fulfill this prediction is very
        small. How would I react in combat, you do what you have to do, the days ahead
        would be tell. Weather cloudy and rainy, morale still excellent. We remained at
        this same status until the 26 July 1944 at 0700 we moved out to location GSGS,
        #4250,# 6 F 4, St. Lo. Sheet: #T496751 to 1/2 mile NW of Airel , France,
        arriving at 1045 a distance of 9 mile. Weather clear and warm, morale excellent.
        On the 25 July 1944 Lt. Col. Wheeler Merriam, our battalion commander, was
        called to division headquarters and told to lead the division through a gap in
        the in the line.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">He was told that the breakthrough would be made by a
        infantry division and it would be an easy advance for the 82nd Recon battalion.
        There were two Combat Commands, CCA and CCB, we were still under division
        control and had the company of the 17th Engineers attached to us, complete with
        a medium tank with a dozer blade attached to use on the hedgerows.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">27 July 1944 company &quot;A&quot; and the 82nd Recon
        moved out into combat from the following location Map: France 1/50,000, GSGS,
        4250, 6 F/3, Coutances sheet: #T389507 1 1/2 miles NE of Notre Dame Le-Leniley
        at 0830. The weather was clear and we were moving on gravel roads the had hedge
        rows on either side, the roads were narrow, this was to be my first day in
        combat and I nor any of the new replacements knew what we could expect, it was
        wait an see. The roads had many craters in them and we had to go around them
        making side passages around them and I can remember going along this road and
        coming out at the top of a a hill, hedgerows on each side and overlooking slight
        valley ahead of us and down the hill into a bunch of trees and hearing small
        arms fire, an occasional artillery shell hit in around the trees to the far side
        of the valley, their was a lot of dust coming from down in those trees. I was
        riding on the back of the M-8 armored car, McCormick, Wagner, Shields, and
        O&quot;Neil were in the armored car, O'Neil was driving. Looking down into this
        bunch of trees and hearing all the gunfire and commotion I was sitting on the
        back of this scout car in the wide open thinking what have I gotten myself into.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">We were following our scout section which consisted of 4
        what they called 4x4's or Peeps ( some called Jeeps or 1/4 tons)). As we went on
        down further into the bunch of trees it was turning out to be lots of shooting
        and light armored tanks running up the road each way, the road was gravel and
        was wide enough for two lane traffic, here it was flat on each side of the road
        and there was quite a bit of dust, the edge of a village to the front of us, but
        we were not quite in the village.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Our armored car was ordered to go down the road to where a
        small one lane road intersected and take a left, this was right at the edge of
        the village and reconnoiter up this little one lane road, so we moved down the
        road and turned to the left and started up this small one lane road alone, we
        were in radio contact with the other vehicles in our platoon and the company
        command post. We started up the one lane road and after about 300 feet we came
        to a small incline, of course that was as far as we could see until we would
        reach the top of the top of this incline we just came to the crown of the
        incline then directly in front of us was a PzKpfw-V-German Panther tank. (This
        tank was introduced before 1942, it weighed 44.8 tons, had a 5 man crew, and
        mounted a 7.5cm Kw K-42 gun. It had a 690 Horsepower Maybach engine which was an
        improvement over the former engine that was first used in this tank called the
        Man engine. It was beset by problems , as the transmission was not big enough
        for all the weight the tank carried. This tank was comparable to the Russian
        built T-34, maximum armor of the Panther was 120mm, it was a powerful opponent.)
        This Panther tank was sitting no more than a hundred feet directly in front of
        us.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">With a German crew riding in a casual position hatches
        open and two of them sitting on the edge of the turret where the 7.5 was
        mounted. They were as surprised as we were and they immediately started getting
        inside to position their 7.5 and to fire on us at point blank range. In the
        meantime our crew was not wasting any time we were all yelling for O'Neill to
        reverse and he did, he was well practiced in reverse driving. O'Neill put it in
        reverse and moved rapidly, faster than I ever dreamed that anyone could drive
        one of these armored cars backwards, he was all over the one lane road but we
        got down to the end of the road in time to back out of the line of fire of the
        tank. and backed the M-8 armored car down where we had entered the one lane road
        before the German tank could get to the crown of the hill and fire on us.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">After we backed out we met an assault tank with a B-6
        Howitzer on it heading down the road and he was going to cross this intersection
        and we tried to stop the assault tank but to no avail, the German Panther tank
        put a shell through the side of the assault tank, we never knew if their were
        any survivors of this assault tank as we were on back then trying to get a
        Bazooka team or a flame thrower over to the side of the tank to try and knock
        him out. It was hard to knock out a German tank from the front because of the
        slant in the front and the amount of armor thickness. The bazooka man was
        wounded in the hand and could not continue, was brought back for medical
        attention. In the meantime flying cover for us were some P-47's and the Company
        Executive officer was in direct contact with the squadron , he immediately
        called them to go for the tank. They were armed with two 500 bombs on each of
        the 4 planes , also they had plenty of other firepower, they came in with the
        bombs at about 1000 feet it was to the back of us and it seemed like that we had
        to duck they came in so low. They started a second run and a German FW 190 go on
        their tail, our radio control warned the squadron leader of this, he did a hook
        and fired 50 caliber into the plane and the German plane went down. It was over
        in a matter of minutes. That day we had the following wounded men Lt. Robert S.
        Frost, Pvt. Alvoid W. Morris Jr., Pfc. Robert Burdine, Lt. Danford J. Bubolz,
        Walter R. Looney. The company had knocked out that day one Mark V German tank,
        three towed 88mm guns, 11 half tracks and numerous other smaller vehicles, also
        we had captured about 125 German soldiers.</font>

<p>
    <font face="Verdana">This day 27 July 1944, I saw my first American dead
        soldier laying along the road and it was heartbreaking, my morale was low.
        Seeing dead American soldiers was the upsetting to all of us, it was certainly a
        sight that we did not like. We were to see many more that day laying in ditches
        along the road or at the side of a buildings, sniping was a fact of life here
        and the Germans were fairly good at it. We arrived at map GSGS, #4250, 6 F/3,
        Coutances, France-sheet: T 389507, 1 and 1/2 mile NE of Notre Dame Le-Leniloy,
        France at 0300 the distance traveled was about 45 miles.</font>
