*********************************************</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">1. Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead. Do not walk ahead of me, for I
may not follow. Do not walk beside me, either; just #$%^ off and leave me alone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">2. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a broken fan belt and a flat
tire.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">3. Don't be irreplaceable; if you can't be replaced, you can't be promoted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">4. No one is listening until you make a mistake.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">5. Always remember you're unique, just like everyone else.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">6. Never test the depth of the water with both feet.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">7. It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply to serve as a warning
to others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">8. It is far more impressive when others discover your good qualities without
your help.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">9. If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car
payments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">10. Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That
way, when you criticize them, you're a mile away and you have their shoes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">11. If you lend someone $20, and never see that person again, it was probably
worth it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">12. Don't squat with your spurs on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">13. If you drink, don't park; accidents cause people.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">14. Some days you are the bug, some days you are the windshield.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">15. The quickest way to double your money is to fold it in half and put it
back in your pocket.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">16. Duct tape is like the force; it has a light side and a dark side, and it
holds the universe together.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">GI HUMOR - Don't mess with a Vet<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
Ed.: SFTT does not endorse the overuse of alcoholic beverages to boost morale or
combat courage...(maybe 1x six-pack...)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">A teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: Get their parents to tell
them a story with a moral at the end of it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The next day the kids came back and one by one began to tell their stories.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Kathy said, &quot;My father's a farmer and we have a lot of egg-laying hens.
One time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the
pickup when we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying and broke and
made a mess.<br>
&quot;And what's the moral of the story?&quot; asked the teacher. &quot;Don't
put all your eggs in one basket!&quot;<br>
&quot;Very good,&quot; said the teacher.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">&quot;Now, Lucy?&quot;<br>
&quot;Our family are farmers too. But we raise chickens for the meat market. We
had a dozen eggs one time, but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks.<br>
And the moral to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're
hatched.&quot;<br>
&quot;That was a fine story Lucy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Johnny do you have a story to share?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my Uncle Bob. Uncle Bob was
a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit. He had to bail out over enemy
territory and all he had was a bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and machete. He
drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he landed right
in the middle of 100 enemy troops.<br>
He killed seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of bullets, then
he killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke and then he killed
the last ten with his bare hands.&quot;<br>
&quot;Good heavens,&quot; said the horrified teacher, &quot; what kind of moral
did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?&quot;<br>
&quot;Don't mess with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking.&quot;<br>

<p><font face="Verdana">When the Master Chief gets home about 9:30 his wife confronts him and asks
him where he's been. The man says, &quot;I cannot lie to you. I spent the better

later, and came right home.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">GI HUMOR - Some Dogs are different</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">four men were bragging about how smart their dogs are.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">The first man was an Engineer, the second was an Accountant, the third a
Chemist, and the fourth was a Government worker.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">To show off, the Engineer called to his dog. &quot;T-Square, do your
stuff.&quot; T-Square trotted over to the desk, took out some paper and promptly
drew a circle, a square, and a triangle.<br>
Everyone agreed that was pretty smart.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">But the Accountant said his dog could do better. He called his dog and said,
&quot;Spreadsheet, do your stuff.&quot; Spreadsheet went out into the kitchen
and returned with a dozen cookies. He divided them into four equal piles of
three cookies each. Everyone agreed that was good.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">But the Chemist said his dog could do better. He called his dog and said,
&quot;Measure, do your stuff.&quot; Measure got up, walked over to the fridge,
took out a quart of milk, got a 10 ounce glass from the cupboard and poured
exactly 8 ounces without spilling a drop!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Everyone agreed that was good. Then the three men turned to the government
worker, and said, &quot;What can your dog do?&quot; The Government worker called
to his dog and said, &quot;Coffee Break, do your stuff.&quot;<br>
Coffee Break slowly got off his feet, ate the cookies, drank the milk, crapped
on the paper, , claimed he injured his back while doing so, filed a grievance
report for unsafe working conditions, put in for workers' compensation, and went
home for the rest of the day on sick leave.<br>

<p><font face="Verdana">Riding A Honda<br>

knocks on the window. The driver of the car opens the window and says,
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br>
The bike responds, &quot;Ever driven a Honda motorcycle?&quot; The driver says,
&quot;No I haven't.&quot;<br>
The biker drives on, until he sees the next car. While passing it, he knocks on
the window.<br>
The driver of the car opens the window and says, &quot;Yes?&quot; The bike
responds, &quot;Ever driven a Honda motorcycle?&quot; The driver says, &quot;No
I haven't.&quot;<br>
Then, suddenly, there is a curve, the biker sees it too late. He crashes off the
road into a ditch.<br>
A car stops and a man runs to the unlucky biker. Covered in blood and surely
dying, the biker asks, &quot;Ever driven a Honda motorcycle?&quot;<br>
The man replies, &quot;Yes I have. I had a Honda for 20 years&quot;.<br>
The biker asks, &quot;Where are the brakes?&quot;</font></p>

He had only hours to live when he suddenly<br>
smelled chocolate chip cookies.<br>

anything else in the world.<br>
<br>
With his last bit of energy, he pulled himself<br>
out of bed, across the floor, and to the stairs.<br>
Then down the stairs and into the kitchen.<br>
<br>
There his wife was baking chocolate chip cookies.As he reached for one, he got
SMACKED across the<br>
back of his hand by the wooden spoon his wife was<br>
holding.<br>
&quot;Leave them alone!&quot; she said, &quot;They're for the funeral!&quot;</font></p>
