    <font face="Verdana">The name &quot;Hobo&quot; first started appearing in the
        early 1800's. Before the Civil War many hoboes had taken to the rails as a way
        of life. Around the time of the Civil War, railroads were being built a an
        astonishing rate and in the early 1870's there were between 50,000 and 60,000
        miles of track interwoven throughout the United States. During the early days
        late 1880's a depressed economy was certainly prevalent, times were hard and
        hoboes took to the rails in great numbers, hitchhikers were also increasing,
        nobody had any money to go anywhere and pay the ticket to get there. By the
        1930's this had grown to about 241,000 miles of track and the trains were
        running to all the bustling markets, Chicago, Michigan and from all points south
        to move raw goods to the industrial northern areas, hauling cattle grain and
        everything else imaginable. Some during the early days would say that the hobo
        was one into doing a lot of bad things, stealing and you name it., that they
        would derail trains and take over the entire train. But in the rural communities
        people would help them and give them jobs during the harvest time. Every hobo
        had a thing that he do real well, repair shoes, make wire fruit bowls and he
        sure could hoe a garden for a little something to eat. Many could play good
        music with a guitar or harmonica, or some other musical instruments. It was not
        uncommon to see a hobo standing in the rear of a house drinking a cup of coffee
        and eating a sandwich, standing up, then doing a little chore for the donor of
        the coffee and food. In around the time that World War 1 was raging and we were
        yet to join in the war, hoboes were running rampant, trying to get into a stable
        work force and maybe settle down and some did, but the number continued to grow.</font>

    <font face="Verdana">By the 1920' the unsettling image was making a change ,
        there were some very notable people that had rode the rails, among them Jack
        London, and author Carl Sandburg, they made it big in their field so many people
        took this to mean that there were some that had it all together and could make a
        go of it , without living around a bunch of trains. A clown made up as a hobo
        caught a lot of attention , what they really did was depict a way of life in
        America, some people could relate to that. During the Great Depression over
        8,000 women &amp; over 200,000 children rode the rails as well.</font>

    <font face="Verdana">In 1932 the Bonus marchers arrived to pressure Hoover for
        their long awaited bonuses, and they were not the same as the hobo who was
        resourceful in making his way and not starving, he made it on the ability to get
        by, they improvised when the chips were down.. The center of the hobo life as
        the camp's or jungles, which were located wherever it was most convenient ,
        preferably close to a railroad track. Generally on the sunny side of a hill near
        a source of water; and as close as as possible to the tracks. No real names were
        given, you used a moniker like Luther the Jet, Hobo Joe and Greenie, Cinder Box
        Cindy, Oklahoma Slim, Guitar Whitey, Mister Bojangles, Midwest John, Boxcar
        Willie (see story below), Gats, New York Maggie, Photo Boll, Pig Train, North
        Bank Fred, New York Ron, Liz Lump, Senator John Mc Claughry, There were certain
        rules, pots were left clean, no fellow hobo was to rob another one. ( who came
        into camp ) Thievery was to be kept to a minimum, maybe a piece of food taken or
        vegetables taken from a garden or something off the clothesline. There was to be
        no breaking into any house or threatening people, these were serious offenses
        and could bring death by a fellow hobo.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Hobo's rode freight trains nearly always. Greenie told me
        that he always carried a railroad spike with a gold painted tip, so he could
        identify as his. He would use this to keep the railroad yardman from closing the
        door on him, which could result in him freezing to death or suffocating, as some
        freight cars were pushed into the rail yard and out of use for weeks at a time.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">In the period leading up to World War 2 saw many hobos,
        going into the 3-c camps and then into the army and serving in World War 2,
        afterward some would take advantage of the GI Bill and enter college or other
        professions. After the war the numbers of hobo's declined rapidly. What used to
        be up to 500 on a freight train in the early 50's would only turn into around 10
        hobo's on a fully loaded freight train. So the handwriting was on the wall, they
        were a group that would be almost extinct in the years to come, but a few still
        lead this life, but the number's remaining are limited. <u>construction ongoing</u></font>

    <font face="Verdana"><strong><u>Boxcar Willie:</u></strong> In Branson, MO.,
        Well known Hobo and Country singer Box Car Willie is back on track in his battle
        against leukemia. The 67-year-old entertainer returned home from the hospital
        Tuesday March 2, 1999, he had received chemotherapy. He had been hospitalized
        for two weeks after cancer treatments left him ill and weak. &quot;He's doing a
        little better,&quot; said his daughter, Tammy La Core. Box Car Willie was
        diagnosed with leukemia in 1996. He was then declared cancer-free in 1997 and
        returned to performing. But the disease returned last April, forcing him to
        cancel his shows in Branson.<strong> </strong>Born Lecil Martin in Sterrett,
        Texas, in 1931, Box Car Willie was the son of a railroad man who used to play
        his fiddle on the porch while his son sat in on guitar. By his teens he had
        graduated to playing in jamborees all over the state, but he gave up show
        business to enlist in the Air Force. He spent 22 years there, logging some
        10,000 hours as a flier, Boxcar Willie died 12 April 1999 at the age of 67. He
        is survived by his wife, two daughters and two sisters.</font>
