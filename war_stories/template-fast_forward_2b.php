    <font face="Verdana">D-Day through St. Lo Breakout
        Continued...</font>
</h1>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">We walked in single file for about three days stopping at
        night then continuing to march slowly during the day, there was always the
        sounds of distance bombing an gunfire as we moved inland. We were always on the
        alert for planes and were strafed one time by the German's about midway on the
        march, one soldier was wounded. On the fifth day in the morning we arrived at an
        open field on a bend of a gravel road, it had a gate big enough for vehicles to
        enter and we all marched in and were told to take a break. About an hour later
        we heard the sound of planes and bombs exploding way off somewhere, then we
        heard the sound of trucks approaching. There were in all about three hundred of
        us. A sergeant called our names to go to different areas of the field to wait,
        we ended up with about twenty different groups after he finished calling names.
        My best friends were all going to different units.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">We were not able to talk or say goodbye to many of our
        friends as we were scattered all around the field, and could not leave our group
        to talk to to our friends. Another truck had carried our duffel bags form the
        beach area and they were dropped off in a big pile, we had to dig our duffel bag
        out of this pile , you can imagine three hundred duffel bags in one big pile,
        this took about an hour. We were loaded into 6x6 trucks army trucks.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">For about an hour we traveled slowly on the road, it was
        shelled out in some areas and been repaired in other sections, there were large
        craters and we had to go off the road to go around some of them. Going around
        these large holes made our trip longer than it would have ordinarily have been.
        Finally we arrived at an open field surrounded by a forest. There was many
        armored vehicles sitting around the edge of the field with full camouflage nets
        over each vehicles. The trees along the edge of the field gave excellent
        coverage for the vehicles along with the camouflage It was 18 June1944.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">We had arrived at the site of our new army unit that we
        were being assigned to. It was the 2nd Armored Division, Company A, 82nd
        Reconnaissance Battalion. We were all ordered to get off the trucks and line up
        to be assigned to a platoon in the company. The first thing I noticed was a
        soldier digging a large hole in the middle of the field it was square, I was to
        find out later this soldier was being disciplined for firing his rifle
        accidentally, this was his punishment. This hole was six foot wide six foot deep
        thus you get what they call a six by six, one of the forms of punishment for
        enlisted men. If you ever dug one you don't want to dig another one. You are
        sweating like hell digging the hole and you buddies are walking by giving you
        that what did you do to deserve this look. I was assigned to an armored car, my
        immediate superior was Sgt. Fleming McCormick, the rest of the four man crew was
        Francis O'Neill, radio man and driver. Luther Shields, assistant driver, Earl
        Wagner, gunner and he rode in the turret with Sgt. McCormick.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">The armored car would only hold four crewman, that is all
        that would fit inside. That made me have to ride on the back of the armored car
        immediately back of the gun turret. I did not know until much later that
        actually what the 2nd Armored was doing was preparing for combat with a twenty
        percent reserve, in other words we were in combat but our next transfer if we
        survived to that point was to take someone's place that was wounded or killed.
        Sometimes the men were wounded or killed before they could be in placed in a
        scout car or become member of a designated crew. So instead of waiting for
        replacements we already had them, this kept the armored vehicles with full crews
        most of the time.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Coming into &quot;A&quot; company that day 18 June1944
        were 15 replacements including myself, there names were the following: Otto F.
        Zitko, Ellis Littlejohn, Charles Pepe, John Taylor, L.G. O'Barr, Howard Swonger,
        Lavier Hatt, Vance Nelson, Boyd West, Sgt. Dee Kirkland who was in charge of us,
        Leslie Herbig, Francis Woods, Virgil Tatom, Thomas W. King, James G. McWilliams,
        Eugene Zubey, and on the 19 June 1944 the following men were also accepted into
        the company: Elmer Hissey, Clyde Hiatt, Herman Emas, Tull Watts, Joe Patton,
        Treffie Lemire, Richard Coon, David Moses, William Druschell, Claude Grindstaff,
        John J. Davis, Arthur Larson, William Nawrocki, Roy Gebenini, James Buschini,
        Harrison Green, Albert Chelich, Pete Garcia, Clarence Warner. Out of these I had
        probably known about ten of them in England before we arrived. Almost all of us
        would be riding as an extra person in some vehicle, we were mostly all privates,
        one was a Sgt.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Here we were assigned to a unit that most all the
        personnel of company &quot;A&quot; had been in the Africa campaign, although in
        a limited action it was a not a combat role. I was not looking forward to the
        days ahead, knowing that we would be in combat shortly, I was assigned to a unit
        that I knew none of the personnel, many of the men were from the south.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">In the armored car which I was assigned there was
        exceptions, O'Neill, was from New York City, Luther Shields was from Oklahoma,
        Earl Wagner was from Pennsylvania, Fleming McCormick was from Georgia. We did
        not know at this time just when we would be committed to combat, actually no one
        knew but we did know that it would be soon. I had a carbine at the time that I
        joined the company so I was told to keep the carbine, it was light and handled
        easily. A carbine, called a M-1- it fired a .32 commercial cartridge, had
        limited power and was designed to replace the pistol, you had a better chance of
        hitting the target with this than a pistol.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">I found the crew that I was joining was taking a wait and
        see attitude toward me, they were waiting to see I guess if I could handle my
        part of the duties they would assign to me, I was the only private in the crew.
        We were eating what we called field rations, C-rations everything out of a can,
        no fresh food. Cigarettes were included in a little 4 cigarettes pack, the
        brands were Spuds, Twenty Grand, Picayune, Lucky Strike, Camel, Old Gold,
        Chelsea. Most of the time in this location our unit sent out friendly patrols to
        other army units nearby just to keep contact. One platoon of another company of
        the battalion went behind enemy line on patrol. So our morning reports would
        read something like this while we are in bivouac here, patrols maintained
        contact throughout the day with friendly troops. Weather changeable, morale
        excellent. We did vehicle maintenance, armored cars had six drive wheels, the
        wheels in the rear were in tandem, so you actually had three wheels aligned in a
        row on each side The armored car was called an M-8 and it had a Hercules rear
        mounted engine had a 37 millimeter M-6 cannon in the turret and a fifty caliber
        machine gun sitting on a mount on the turret. We did not get all the 50
        caliber's until we reached Normandy , we got some from a Beach Brigade( a
        salvage outfit ). You could get anything you wanted, as long as it had not been
        inventoried there, that is how the scout sections received their Bar's and
        everyone else got there 45 Colt automatic's. When we got to Berlin and fell out
        for our first review A Company was the only company completely outfitted with
        Colt 45's, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; companies had Sub-Machine guns. The
        armored car could move out at a top speed of 56 miles per hour and could go
        about as fast backward as it could forward, the problem was being able to steer
        backwards as you had to be guided by the armored car commander, you had no rear
        view mirror. Most drivers had a good knack to run the car backward, simply by
        watching the alignment of the vehicle and keep it straight or turn to fit it
        into a suitable area for concealment from the enemy.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">During the time we were bivouacked here I was able to get
        to know some of the men, some were hard to know, of course everyone had the
        thought that this was just about the time that we were going to be committed to
        combat, the days were counting down. Lt. Cook was our platoon leader, he had
        been a Greyhound bus driver and had a bad back, and was always seemed to be in
        pain on different occasions, he would later leave the company because of this.
        We were continuing to run friendly patrol to the units around us to be sure that
        there had not been any Germans infiltrating back to this area.</font>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <font face="Verdana">The vehicles were supplied with bright
        colored panels of all different colors, they were about 6 foot wide and 4 foot
        long , these were to be put on your vehicle during the day, they had rope to tie
        them on the scout car and the larger vehicle so that they would be visible from
        the air so that our planes would be able to identify us when they were looking
        for enemy columns to strafe, and would not attack our column by mistake. It was
        right after this time that the 8th Air Force made a strike an General McNair and
        about 300 other American soldiers were killed by this attack of planes.</font>
