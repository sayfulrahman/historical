        <b><u>Alenus, Willy.</u></b> To friends of the US 82nd Armored
        Recce Battl. (Colonel Wheeler MERRIAM) our liberators in the triangle Hasselt -
        Maaseik - Maastricht (Sept. 44) . My name is Willy D. F. ALENUS. I was born in
        Hasselt, on 5 October 1932. On 7 September 1944, when you arrived in Hasselt, I
        was 11 years and 11 months young. But I was NOT physically in Hasselt in
        September 1944. On the 11th you crossed the Albert Canal at Beeringen and
        started conquering the area within the above triangle. At 11 o’ clock, at
        Opglabbeek, my 40 years’ old father fell into the hands of Parachute Infantry
        of the 24th Regiment, HÜBNER/ MATTHAEAS and of the 21st Para- Regiment,
        LÖYTVED- HARDEGG. He was summarily court- martialed to death and shot on the
        spot.On the 12th of September, Able for ‘A’ Company, coming from the north (Meeuwen-
        Gruitrode), did not secure Opglabbeek, defended as it was by Major Ulrich
        MATTHAEAS and at least one 8, 8 cm anti- tank gun (or 88mm as we call it). But a
        relevant ‘after action report’ entry reads, -&quot;On the 14th of September
        the ‘C’ Company HQ with the 3rd platoon in reserve, moved from Beeringen,
        Zonhoven, Winterslag, Waterschei- Cité (where Willy spent the 1940 - 1944 war
        years of German occupation), to Zutendaal. The 1st platoon moved from Beeringen
        at first light, to the north of the wooded area north of Winterslag to
        Opglabbeek, Asch and joined the Company at Waterschei.&quot; MATTHAEAS and his
        fierce Paratroops had vacated Opglabbeek during the night of 13 / 14 September
        and moved to Kinrooi, to the north- east, close to the Holland- Limburg border.
        Major Ulrich MATTHAEAS died at Bad Bevensen (Niedersachsen), on 21
        June 1994. He was 83 years old. Consequently, I was war orphaned, - fatherless,
        not motherless, - at Opglabbeek on 11 September 1944. But on the 14th at 40
        Gordellaan, Waterschei- Cité, suddenly appeared apparently out of nowhere, half
        a dozen - 8 Greyhound and/ or Sherman’s of ‘Charlie’ for ‘C’ Company
        HQ, as I know to- day they were. More than half a century later, the above
        location remains virtually unchanged, which might both help and fascinate
        visiting veterans. Unaware of my father’ s gruesome fate (that he had been
        killed three days before) and realizing that the ‘American Army’, - that is
        what we called you in those days, - planned to scout the Asch area and Zutendaal
        (Wiemismeer), Willy and friend managed to explain with almost no knowledge of
        the English language, that there was such a thing as a short and easy cut to
        Asch- station where &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; obviously wanted to go. I. e. to
        follow the railroad track from Waterschei- station to Asch- station. Eventually,
        if I remember well, the scheme worked and I have already circulated among
        veterans a recently discovered photograph, featuring &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;
        entering Asch, surrounded by Belgian teenagers including young Willy, friend(s)
        and bicycle. Willy achieved a complete overseas career. Colonial,
        Development Co- operation and United Nations. He retired on 1st January 1991.
        The King of the Belgians bestowed on him the Honorary Rank, Title and Pension of
        Hon. Provincial Commissioner (B. C.), the Civil Service equivalent of full
        Colonel. Willy lives most of the time at B- 8400 Oostende (Belgium), Zeedijk
        357, phone + 32 59 70 23 09 - fax + 32 59 50 48 79 - E- mail - willy.alenus@skynet.be.
        He owns a small, self contained guest- house on the Zeedijk (‘Seadyke’) in
        Oostende, and is able and willing to accommodate, free of charge, two visiting
        adults. Senior soldiers and companion, planning to travel to Belgium to visit
        the North Sea coast, should not hesitate to call upon Willy ALENUS for possibly
        needed assistance. On 5 June 1999 he welcomed old friends in Deauville.
        (1109opgl). I think that this speaks for itself, All the members of the 82nd
        &amp; the 2nd Armored Division appreciate the efforts of Willy, to honor our
        fallen hero's.

        <strong>Bradley, Omar, Gen.: </strong>(12
        Feb. 1893 to 8 April 1981) Born in Clark, Missouri, graduated from West Point in
        1915, and commissioned in the infantry. A protégé of Eisenhower, who had been
        in the same class at West Point. Served with the 14th Infantry Division in
        various posts in Washington and Arizona, received promotions to first lieutenant
        in July 1916, and captain in May 1917, then to temporary major in June 1918.
        Spent a few months at Camp Grange, Illinois, then professor of military science
        at South Dakota State College in Sept 1919. Reverted to captain in Jan. 1920.
        Later same year became instructor at West Point stayed there until 1924. Then on
        to Ft. Benning, Ga., to graduated from the Infantry School in 1925. Spent three
        years at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, then on to Command and General Staff
        School, at Ft. Leavenworth, Ks. in 1929. From 1929 to 1933 he was an instructor
        at the Infantry School. Graduated from the War College in 1934, then again
        instructor at West Point until 1938. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in June
        1936. In 1938 Bradley was ordered to duty with the General Staff, and promoted
        to brigadier general, in Feb. 1941. His early career included many years as a
        formal instructor, However, his contribution to training was by no means
        insignificant. he served as Commandant of the Infantry School from March 1941 to
        Feb. 1941. Then to temporary mg to command the 92nd Infantry Division ( later to
        be the 82nd Airborne) at Camp Claiborne, La. From June 1942 to Jan. 1943 he had
        the 28th Infantry Division at Camp Livingston, La. General Bradley, of course,
        is best recognized as the empathetic &quot;G.I.'s General&quot; and the able
        commander of the largest American army ever fielded under a single commander. In
        Tunisia and Sicily, he commanded American troops who first learned the lessons
        of actual combat. Short time later he was ordered to N. Africa there he was
        appointed as an aide to Gen. Eisenhower until April 1942. His career was also
        linked with Patton's. Bradley first took command of the 11 Corps, from Patton,
        in North Africa. His troops immediately stormed the German held city of Bizerte
        on 7 May 1943 and took 40,000 prisoners. The II Corps captured Bizerte, Tunis,
        on 8 May 1942. Promoted to temporary lieutenant general in June 1942. Bradley
        led the II Corp's, then part of Patton's Seventh Army, in the landing at Gela
        and Scoglitti, Sicily, on 10 July 1942.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Sept.1942 he was called to England to assist in the
        planning of the invasion of Normandy. In Oct. 1943 he was named commander of the
        First United States Army Group (FUSAG) for that purpose. As a commander at that
        level he was held responsible to Gen. Courtney H. Hodges and the Third was under
        command of Gen. Patton, which together carried the advance of the center and and
        right across most of Europe. In Jan.1944, Bradley would be in command of the
        center wing, landed in Utah and Omaha beaches, Normandy on D-Day, 6 June 1944.
        The end of July the First Army made the breakthrough at St. Lo. that released
        the the Allies from the Cotentin Peninsula. His greatest contribution to the war
        effort was his part in the Operation Overlord (invasion of France). He was
        chosen to lead the D-Day assault on the beaches of Normandy, France 6 June 1944.
        Gen. Bradley was receiving less than $13,000 a year as a Four Star General in
        1946. In assessing Bradley, noted military historian, Martin Blumenson, predicts
        that he will be remembered for, among other things, his &quot;superb work as
        combat trainer and commander.&quot; In 1948 he succeeded Gen.. Eisenhower as
        Chief of Staff of the Army, holding that post until August 1949, when he became
        the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He was promoted to general of
        the army in Sept. 1950. In 1951 he published &quot; A Soldier's Story &quot;, a
        memoir, and in August 1953 he retired. He served as Chairman of the Board of the
        Bulova Watch Company in 1958. He was a Soldier's soldier, and a good
        general. Look for more later.

        <strong>Brooks, Edward Hale, Lt. Gen.: </strong>(25 April
        1893 to 10 Oct.1978) Edward Hale Brooks was born on 25 April 1893 in Concord,
        NH. His father, Edward Waite Brooks, was a salesman. His mother was the former
        Mary Frances Hale. Ted Brooks had three sisters, Harriet, Gretchen and Alice
        Brooks. Both Gretchen and Alice died in their infancy. He was graduated from
        Concord (NH) High School, after which he attended Norwich University (The
        Military College of New England) in Northfield, VT., graduating in 1916 with a
        Bachelor of Science Degree in Civil Engineering. He later also received a
        master's degree from Norwich University and an honorary doctoral degree in
        military science from Pennsylvania Military College.
    </p>
    <p>
        He began his military career in June 1915 as a Captain
        with the 1st Cavalry of the Vermont National Guard. During WW1, he served with
        the 3rd Division in five major engagements. He was first a Battery Commander in
        the 76th FA and later assistant G-3 of the 3rd FA Brigade. During the
        Meuse-Argonne campaign, he earned a Distinguished Service Cross when he
        &quot;... exposed himself to heavy and accurate artillery fire directed on an
        ammunition train while driving a loaded ammunition truck to safety, the driver
        of which had been killed by enemy fire.&quot; He was in the Army of Occupation
        in Europe until Aug. 1919. Gen. Brooks was a member of the 3rd Div. football
        team. In 1921, at the American Legion Convention in Kansas City, he captained
        the Army team that defeated Great Lakes Naval Training Station 20-6. Served as a
        Gunnery instructor at Ft. Sill, OK, from 1922 to 1926, then was in the
        Philippines for two years where he had command of Battery D of the 24th Field
        Artillery, a pack mule outfit. He was then transferred to Ft. Riley, KS, served
        there 1928 to 1932. There his artillery battery, a horse drawn outfit, was the
        first to complete a 100 mile forced march in less than 24 hours. It was an
        accomplishment produced by vigorous training of both men and animals. 1932-1934
        attended Command and General Staff school at Ft. Leavenworth, KS, then to
        Harvard University as ROTC instructor from 1934 to 1936. Attended War College
        1936-1937 and was detailed as an instructor in the attack section of the Command
        and General Staff School.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gen. Brooks was chief of the statistics branch of the old
        War Department General Staff from 1939 to 1941 where he was closely associated
        with Gen. Marshall and Secretary Stimpson. By this time he had risen to the rank
        of LTC. In September 1941, Gen. Jacob L. Devers requested that Gen. Brooks be
        named to the staff of the new armored force being formed at Ft. Knox, Ky. With
        this came promotion to Brigadier General. Consequently, he never wore eagles! In
        1942 he was promoted once again to Major General. In this capacity he played a
        major in development of the M-7 self-propelled artillery piece and the M-8,

        From 1942 he was commander of the 11th Armored Division
        until 1944, when he was sent to England to take command of the<strong> 2nd
            Armored Division (&quot;Hell on Wheels&quot;)</strong> and led that elite unit
        into Normandy. The division was prominent in the break-through at St. Lo,
        crossed the Rhine, and was said to be the first Allied division to enter
        Belgium. Gen. Brooks contributed, in particular, his skills in artillery
        coordination to the division. Gen. Brooks was awarded a Silver Star for
        repeatedly attacking enemy positions along his line and for the rapid commitment
        of his division against the enemy. He was cited for &quot; personal gallantry
        and leadership.&quot; Later in the war he rose to the command of the VI Corps
        and its nearly 150,000 men. Accepting the surrender of the German 19th Army
        during this time (two days before V-E day) was what he considered to be one of
        his greatest achievements. It was shortly thereafter when one of his deepest
        personal tragedies occurred, the death of his son, Maj. Edward Hale Brooks, Jr.
        (USMA Jan 1943), in an airplane crash in Germany after the war had ended. This
        left him with his wife, Bea, his daughter, Betty, and her husband, R. Potter
        Campbell, Jr. (USMA 1941).

        In 1949 Gen. Brooks was promoted to LTG when he was named
        assistant chief of staff for personnel (G-1). He then served as commanding
        general of the 2nd Army at Fort Meade, MD from 1951 until he retired from active
        service in 1953. He lived another blissful 25 years in Concord, NH, dedicated to
        his family and hobbies of fishing and gardening. ( The following paragraph is an
        excerpt from his eulogy as written and presented by Gen. Charles D. Palmer.)
        &quot;He was an exceptional and courageous leader who inspired confidence,
        demanded much of his subordinates but gave more of himself, was very strict but
        fair, never sought personal power and glory. He pushed forward deserving
        subordinates, but never pushed forward himself, was very modest and very human.
        Subordinates sometimes referred to him as a &quot;lucky general&quot; not
        meaning that he himself was lucky but that he was lucky for them - such was
        their confidence that he and they would succeed.&quot; Gen. Brooks was known as
        &quot;standing Eddie&quot; for his unusual habit of standing up in his jeep as
        he reviewed the troops so he could better see them. He even had a special
        railing welded into the jeep to hold onto for this purpose. An example of his
        legendary fairness is the story of his hiking 20 miles himself in full pack in
        order to set a reasonable time in which to expect his troops to complete it. He
        was much beloved and respected by his family. He taught his grandchildren and
        great-grandchildren to fish and camp, he cared about and was beloved by all the
        children of our family. A finer man and role-model we couldn't have asked for.
        Apparently his comrades felt likewise, for his walls were lined with signed
        pictures from the likes of Eisenhower, Churchill, Montgomery, Bradley and others
        voicing their respect for the &quot;great warrior&quot;. He was the man we
        called &quot;the General&quot;, &quot;the old Indian fighter&quot;, and
        &quot;standing Eddie&quot;. His grandchildren and great-grandchildren just
        called him Daddy-Pop, and we were all the better for having known him. The above

    <p>
       This is a translation of the article of the daily paper &quot;De Limburger&quot; in
                Holland referring to De
                    Limburger June 16th 1999 World
                    War Two veteran finds peace at grave of his comrade. <strong><u>The American Sergeant

                            Colligan </u></strong>(81)
                    lost on the 8th of October 1944 his best friend Philip Bylewski during a tank
                    battle. Almost 55 years after WW 2, he got at long last the chance to visit in
                    Henri Chapelle the grave of his deceased comrade. Story by Peter van den
                    Berg.
                    Henri Chapelle: Standing lined up looks Arthur Colligan at
                    the thousands of marble crosses on the American Cemetery at Henri Chapelle.
                    For a moment the 81 year old robust man gets emotional.
                    After that the former tank commander wants just one thing. He can't wait to step
                    on the just cut lawn. Searching for Philip Bylewski. With a crumpled piece of
                    paper in his hand Colligan walks the gravel walk. Section F, row 8, grave 61.
                    There must Phil be buried, he whispers almost unintelligible. Arthur stands a
                    few seconds at each grave he passes. As a token of respect for his killed
                    colleagues. When Colligan at last stands eye to eye at the grave of Philip
                    Bylewski, it's for him impossible to say something for a couple of minutes.
                    Arthur Colligan says a prayer and crosses o.s. Full
                    with love he puts his hand on the white cross. He wants to touch his best friend
                    for a while. I've been waiting for
                    this moment for 55 years. It was my duty to return to Europe to see the grave of
                    Philip. He's laying here so beautiful. This is a peaceful place. It's giving me peace, that at last
                    I can
                    say goodbye in a
                    dignified way. He deserved it. &quot;His
                    thoughts are going back to the 8 th of October 1944, the day Philip Bylewski got
                    killed, at the age of 25, by shell-fire. It seemed that Philip felt that he was
                    going to die. The day before, he went suddenly to church, to pray. Philip was a
                    religious man. He must have felt that something very serious was going to
                    happen. Sergeant Arthur Colligan saw
                    Philip Bylewski dying for his eyes during a tank battle at the German place
                    Baesweiler. He himself got very
                    heavy injured. He lost one eye and his right hand was shattered. The loss of
                    Philip did more to me than my own injuries. I
                    knew Philip from the beginning of the war. Four years we spent each hour
                    together. He was my buddy. Of the 117 soldiers of my company 15 men returned
                    alive to the US after the war. I was one of the lucky few, but it cost me years
                    to work up mental the death of Philip. &quot;The
                    visit of the Belgian Cemetery is for Arthur Colligan (81) the highlight of his
                    trip to Holland. For two weeks he
                    stays in Limburg on invitation of Gerard Boumans (72) from Linne.Boumans lived
                    during the war in Oirsbeek. As a 17 year old teenager he met the American
                    soldier, after the village was liberated by the tank regiment &quot;Hell on
                    Wheels&quot;. I've met Art on the 18th of Sept. 1944. The tanks stood close by
                    our house, hidden for German planes, in the orchard. He gave me his address. One way of another I
                    felt
                    myself strongly connected to
                    those boys. I saw the frightened glance in their eyes. Those soldiers knew they
                    were going to meet death. For 48
                    years Gerard Boumans did nothing with the address of Colligan. I saw the piece
                    of paper off and on in a drawer, but I had my own family and pursuits. It didn't have the time to
                    contact
                    him. After Boumans
                    realized that he was getting older, he got the feeling, that he wanted to know
                    if Arthur Colligan was still alive. By
                    an acquaintance in the US, he got to know the residence of the former sergeant. An intensive
                    correspondence
                    followed. Last year Boumans
                    visited his liberator in Beaver Dam, a little town of 14.000 inhabitant, in the
                    state of Wisconsin. He invited
                    Colligan directly to come to the Netherlands. Boumans took him the last few days
                    to all the places he had been 55 years ago. The environs have changed. I can
                    remember a few things, says Arthur Colligan. The
                    church towers in the villages, give me back horrible memories. The were used by
                    German snipers to shoot at us. While
                    Arthur Colligan walks between the crosses, he notices that in 55 years after the
                    Second World War less has changed. If I see what happens in Kosovo, I get tears
                    in my eyes. Hitler was a dictator. Now they have an other name, Milosevic or
                    Saddam Hussein, it doesn't make the difference. I approve the way they deal with
                    them. What we have gone through, may never return.This
                    is the whole article. Sincerely Henk Smid

        <strong>Harmon, Ernest Nason :(&quot;Gravel Voice&quot;,
            General) :</strong> (26 Feb1894 to 1979) Born in Lowell, Ma., he grew up there
        and in West Newbury, Vt. He attended Norwich University for a year then entered
        West Point, graduating from there in 1917 receiving a commission in the cavalry.
        He was promoted to first lieutenant in May 1917, and then to temporary captain
        in Aug., being sent on to France in March 1918. He saw action in the St. Mihiel
        and Muese-Argonne operations. He was promoted to permanent captain in Aug. 1920,
        an graduated from the Cavalry School, Ft. Riley, Kansas in 1921. He also
        competed in the Paris Olympics in 1924, in the modern pentathlon. Then was an
        instructor at West Point until 1925. From 1927 to 1931 he taught military
        tactics at Norwich University. He went on to graduate from the Command and
        General Staff School at Ft. Leavenworth, Ks. and being promoted to major in
        Nov,1932. He graduated from the Army War College in 1934, and from 1935 to 1939
        was attached to the General Staff. In 1940 he was promoted to lieutenant colonel
        and named assistant chief of staff of the I Armored Corps. It was a newly
        organized corps and Gen. Adna R. Chaffee was heading this force at Ft. Knox, Ky.
        In Nov. 1941 he was appointed a temporary brigadier general and became chief of
        staff of the Armed Forces Hdq. In July of 1942 he took command of the 2nd
        Armored Div.. and advanced in rank to temporary major general the following
        month.
    </p>
    <p>
        He led an advance part of the 2nd Armored Division in the
        landing in French Morocco in November 1942 and then on into Tunisia. April of
        1943 took command of the 1st Armored Div. and was assigned to the VI Corp's,
        which was under the command of Gen. John P. Lucas. On 9 Sept. 1943 took part in
        the landing as a part of Gen. Mark Clark's 5th Army at Salerno and Paestum,
        Italy. In Jan. 1944 the 1st moved to the beachhead at Anzio under the VI Corp's
        and in May 1944 led the breakout to form the beachhead. The 1st Armored was the
        first division to cross the Tiber River, then on to Rome, Italy and beyond.
        Covering over 200 miles in 5 days. July of 1944 Gen. Harmon was transferred to
        command the VIII Corp's at Camp Bowie, Texas. He then returned to the 2nd
        Armored Div. in Belgium, Sept. 1944. The 2nd was assigned to Gen. Courtney H.
        Hodge's First Army and then to Gen. William H. Simpson's First Army which
        included the 2nd Armored Div. which broke through the Siegfried Line at Aachen,
        Germany in October. During the months of Oct. and Nov. 1944 was the one of the
        2nd Armored Divs. most difficult times, as they were engaged in one of the most
        bitter fought tank battles on the western front. Gen. Harmon showed
        extraordinary perception of what enemy movements might mean and the ability to
        make immediate adjustments in the classment of his available units to out
        maneuver the German panzer divisions, along with their infantry. At times having
        other units that were not attached the 2nd Armored to assist him, and some just
        simply refused, others would help him. Then in late at night at 2350 on 21
        December of 1944 the 2nd Armored Division was ordered to travel overnight from
        the Aachen area to take up position in the Ardennes Offensive. The division
        traveled over 100 miles to then gather in the vicinity of Huy, Belgium, to
        assemble. Gen. Harmon again took to the offensive in an attempt to push the
        Germans back and to meet them on his terms. Fighting in freezing cold weather
        with snow ( and insufficient winter gear ) on the ground most of the time the
        Ardennes Offensive was a very hard struggle for the 2nd Armored Div.. With
        decisive bold armored tactics and movements he was able to block the enemy's
        advance and gain ground while doing so. Then later in January 1945 he was named
        Commander of the XX11 Corps which in April 1945 had control of the northern part
        of the Rhine Province. Later at the end of 1945 he briefly commanded the <strong>Third
            Army </strong>occupying Czechoslovakia. In February 1946 he took command of the
        VI Corp's in Germany, which developed into a military police force known as the
        U.S. Constabulary (was designated this in May 1946). This force was responsible
        for the entire U.S. occupational zone. He would then be become deputy commander
        Army Ground Forces in early 1947. Gen. Harmon retired in March 1948. He was
        named in 1950 as President of Norwich University, and served there until 1965.
        He retired to Florida in 1970 and wrote a volume of memoirs titled &quot;Combat
        Command&quot;. We rate Gen. Harmon as one of the best 2nd Armored Division
        Commanders.

        <strong>Jeffares, Emory L., S/Sgt.: </strong>( 5 March
        1922 to 9 Nov. 2000 ) He was born 5
        March 1922 to Emory Lee Jeffares and Mary B. Pipper. ( Jeffares ) in Atlanta,
        Ga. and attended grade school, middle school and high school in Atlanta, Ga.
        While going to school Emory L. worked in a body shop after school and some
        Saturdays making one dollar a week. In the summer he would make six dollars a
        week working 12 hours a day. During this period of time he was learning to be an
        auto painter. After getting out of school he decided to enlist in the army, and
        did so on 7 August 1940. He was sent to the 2nd Armored Div., 2nd Reconnaissance
        Battalion in Ft. Benning, Georgia, this division was just forming. ( later
        becoming the 82nd Reconnaissance Battalion ) Emory L. was assigned to Company
        &quot;A&quot;, 2nd platoon. He was to stay with &quot;A&quot; Company, 2nd
        platoon throughout his army life. He was promoted to Corporal in September 1942,
        was sent to North Africa in December 1942. In Aug. 1943 was sent to Palermo,
        Sicily for patrol duty, and occupational duties until November 1943. Then he was
        transferred to Tidworth Barracks in England for intensive training and to
        receive new equipment. All of this in preparation for the invasion of France. In
        Tidworth he was promoted to Sgt. Sgt. Jeffares was still with his unit the Co.
        &quot;A&quot;, 2nd platoon, 82nd Reconnaissance Battalion, and with his unit
        boarded an LST and arrived off the coast of France ( Omaha Beach) on D+2, they
        couldn't go ashore because of the tide, they had to stay on the British LST
        until the next day, going ashore on D+3. Sgt. Jeffares would stay as a scout car
        commander throughout the drive across northern Europe and on into Holland.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the night of 21 Dec. 1944 the entire 2nd Armored Div.
        was sent overnight, starting at 2300 hrs to Acquier, Belgium traveling with
        blackout lights on all vehicles. The roads were very bad with slush and much
        snow on the ground. The 2nd Armored was then at 1000 (10:00 AM) moved to
        Havelange, Belgium, and immediately committed to action against the Germans. The
        enemy had made a breakthrough and the 2nd Armored was being rushed to that area
        to stop the German advance. This was a rough period of time for the 2nd Armored
        Div., they were not equipped for winter combat fighting, but faced this
        assignment with determination. It was cold miserable you name it, the worst
        weather must of us had ever experienced. On 12 Jan. 1945 the company mission was
        to hold portion of line south of Samree, Belgium and to clear the woods to the
        east of the line positions. We were to advance in a line Sgt. Jeffares squad on
        the left. Sgt. Jeffares saw a field telephone hanging over a tree right over the
        German entrenched position about 200 ft. to the front. The firing from the
        Germans began just after Sgt..Jeffares noticed this, we suffered several
        casualties. The left squad took most of the casualties. Tech /5 Isaac Duhon (
        was a close friend, his name is also written in this column) and Pfc. John V.
        McMahon were killed by rifle fire. <strong>The following were wounded, Sgt.
            Emory L. Jeffares, and. Pfc. William M. Polk.</strong>, <strong>Pfc. Oliver
            Owens,</strong> all 2nd platoon. We pulled back, Sgt. Jeffares and Pfc. Owens
        ended up in England in a hospital.. Sgt. Jeffares then returned to the states
        and was discharged on 7 August 1945 from the Finney General Hospital at
        Thomasville, Georgia.

        He went to work painting automobiles and would marry Miss.
        Holly Tallman on 18 May 1946. In 1962 he became manager of the body shop where
        he was working. After a long and happy marriage Mrs. Holly Jeffares passed away
        16 Oct.1989 after a long illness.. He retired in 1984, Mr. Emory L. Jeffares now
        lives in a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia. I once asked Sgt. Jeffares while we were
        waiting for the St. Lo breakthrough to begin in July 1944, this question, why
        did he join the Army?, his reply was &quot; I didn't have anyplace else to go.
        This was true in some cases, for those that would volunteer around this time,
        but also they had a sense of patriotism. It was men like Sgt. Emory L. Jeffares
        that made up the members of the 2nd Armored Division's early on, and under Gen.
        George Patton became the very best Armored Division that the United States had
        to offer in WW 2. The men of this great division were ready to offer their lives
        for their country. We consider these men along with Sgt. Emory L. Jeffares to be

            The following is the story of a family that lost a
            loved one in World War 11. This is just one, there were many. What more can one
            give for his country, than to give his life.
        </strong></p>
    <p>
        <strong>Kingery, Pvt. Morris Harold: ( </strong>25 June
        1916 to 27 Nov.1944 ) Morris Harold Kingery was born in the small town of
        Holdenville, Oklahoma. Holdenville is about 80 miles east of Oklahoma
        City. His parents were Lena and Rannie Kingery. He was their only
        child. Because of his size, he was called &quot;Buster&quot; from the time
        he was born. His dad worked his whole life for the Frisco Railroad and
        retired in Holdenville. My dad grew up and went through school in the same
        town that his maternal grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins lived, and he had
        a lot of friends. With great humor, he was a tall curly headed guy that
        would give anybody help that needed it. He also had some of that Irish
        temper from his Mother's side. I have been told stories that I thought
        were an example of his temper and humor. His mother told him he couldn't
        drive the family car and locked up in the garage. So he drove it through
        the garage door. I cherish the picture I have of him and his real
        pretty 1931 Model &quot;A&quot; Ford roadster. That was quite the car for
        a guy in his late teens. He ended up driving it into the Holdenville lake
        (not on purpose), but he sure was upset. He dated Jimmy Roger's daughter.
        She got mad at him because he was late for a date one night. She lived in
        Wewoka, Oklahoma about 8 miles from Holdenville. When he did show up, she
        started throwing her dad's music records at him and broke a lot of what
        would become collectable records.
    </p>
    <p>
        He started his work career in sales for a bread company in
        Holdenville. He moved to Ada, Ok. when he and my mother married. They were
        both 21 years old in 1937 and had never lived anywhere other than Holdenville.
        My mother, Lorene (Loftis) Kingery, was raised by her mother and dad, a farmer,
        furniture store owner and preacher, who wasn't all together sure she should date
        or marry this big fun loving Irish guy. She had two brothers and one
        sister. One brother was a good friend of my dad, and they got into a lot
        of mischief together. So this helped my dad get a date with my mother, and
        he settled down a lot (or enough to please my grandfather).My dad went to
        work for a milk company in Ada.He stayed with the milk company for
        as long as he could but said he was going to have to find something where
        he didn't break bottles. They took every bottle you broke out of your
        paycheck. So my parents moved to Oklahoma City where my dad worked for
        Borden's Milk Company until he joined the army. I was born after they
        moved to Oklahoma City in November 1939. My mother and I used to go to a
        park that was right across the street from the Borden's plant, and we met my dad
        after he got off work. I have memories of him swinging me high in the park
        swings. He was able to buy a pie route and was really doing well working both
        jobs. He was a great sales person. We bought a home in Oklahoma
        City. By then, the war was getting worse, and he joined the army to serve his
        country as so many others had. We had a real good friend who also owned a
        pie route in Oklahoma City. He took my dad's business and ran both to keep
        the business going.
    </p>
    <p>
        In April 1944 at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma, he went for his
        induction and then to boot camp at Camp Joseph T. Robinson, Ar. Then he
        went to Camp Meade in Md. where he left in Sept.1944 for overseas. He
        would be assigned to Company &quot;G&quot;, 41st Armored Inf. Bn. 2nd Armored
        Div. His last letter was written 25 November 1944, and mailed from
        Germany. He was reported KIA ( Killed in Action ) 27 Nov. 1944, Northwest
        of Merzenhausen, Germany, near the Roer River. Artillery was heavy along this
        Roer River line. &quot;C&quot; Company, 82nd Reconnaissance Bn. would relieve
        Company &quot;G&quot; on 28 November 1944 from this line I was five on 19
        November 1944. I remember a uniformed (not sure what kind) man at the
        front door to our house who informed us of my dad's death. I also remember
        the decorated Christmas tree in the living room. My dad is buried at Margraten
        cemetery in Holland. My grandmother could not face the fact he'd been
        killed and asked my mother to not bring him home that way. She never
        talked about him. She had lost her only child.
    </p>
    <p>
        My mother never got to visit where my dad is buried, but I
        have been fortunate enough to visit twice. It is a beautifully cared for resting
        place, and as Mike Ariano also of the 41st armored infantry Co G said,
        &quot;he's with his buddies&quot;. As I was growing up, I had a
        problem with the fact I didn't understand where he was. It helped a lot to
        visit the place he had been laid to rest. He left a widow who always said
        he was the best husband and for which anyone could ever have asked. He
        left one daughter who is writing this memory in his honor, with all my love.

        <b><u>Lane, Major Robert A.: </u></b>Born 25 January 1913 -23 August
        1944. Robert was born in Marietta, Ohio, graduated from Marietta
        High School in 1930, and that September entered Ohio State University.
        Four years later, he graduated from OSU, in June, and in August married LaVerne
        Shaffer. In Dec.1940 left Fort Meade, MD with Lt. Ralph Luman and
        others for Fort Benning, Georgia. They were activated and assigned to the
        2ndArmored Division..<br>
        Before the holidays in 1942, he had to say good-bye to LaVerne<br>
        and his children. Lt. Lane stayed with the 2nd Armored Division throughout
        his service. Far from his wife and family, Bob celebrated his 30th birthday with
        his 2nd Armored friends in the cork forest, the Foret de Mamora, near Rabat,
        French Morocco. That Christmas was spent in Morocco was mild compared to the
        damp, cold &quot;Merry Olde&quot; English Christmas at Tidworth Barracks in
        1943. Going from Africa to Sicily to England was quite a contrast, to include
        the intense heat the men experienced during and after the battle for Sicily.
        Promoted to Major, Bob became the S-2 for Combat Command B, before they
        sailed into Normandy, June 1944. He advanced through the hedgerows, taking
        part in the breakthrough at St. Lo, passed the Falaise Gap, to Conches, France.
        At the forward command post near Conches, France on Wednesday afternoon 23
        August he was struck in the back by exploding Nebelwefer ( Commonly known
        as &quot;Screaming Meenie&quot; rockets. ) Major Robert A.
        Lane is buried at the Normandy American Cemetery at Omaha beach with 134 of his
        friends in the 2nd Armored Division. Respectfully, Sandra Lane Walker, Robert's
        daughter.

        <strong>McGorman, Frank L.:</strong> ( 24 May
        1925 to 17 Dec. 1986 ).My brother Frank L.( Bud ) McGorman ( ASN #37571728 )
        served in the HQ. 1st Bn., 67th Armored Regiment, 2nd Armored Division. He was
        injured in battle in Conchies France, August 22, 1944, and remained totally
        disabled &quot;shell shock&quot; until his death. .Frank received the
        bronze star for meritorious service in action against the enemy on 22 Aug. 1944
        in France. &quot;During this action, in the vicinity of Conches France, the
        forward artillery observer's tank came into close contact with a large enemy
        force. Private McGorman, an extra crew member, was riding on the back of the
        tank when it contacted the enemy. Sensing the vulnerability of his tank to
        the enemy foot troops, Private McGorman, although exposed to heavy small arms
        and artillery fire, voluntarily dismounted from the tank and acted as dismounted
        infantry to protect the tank's flank so that the artillery observer could
        continue his fire missions. Firing his weapon continuously and inflicting
        severe casualties on the enemy, Private McGorman, in all probability, saved his
        tank from a flank or rear attack. By his audacious courage, fine
        initiative and disregard for himself, acted in the highest traditions of the
        Military Service. Entered the military service from Minnesota.&quot;
        Citation was signed by Major General E. N. Harmon, Office of the Division
        Commander, APO 252. My brother had also received first degree wounds in a
        previous battle, and should have received the purple heart for his
        actions. The records in St. Louis were destroyed by fire, and therefore my
        brother never got his medal. I tried for years to write everyone that might be
        able to help, but was unable to succeed. I was a small child when my brother was
        in the war, but my family always read his letters home and I was proud of him
        even as a small child. I am still extremely proud of Frank, and have his
        medal framed in our home. My children also were very proud of their uncle
        Frank referred to as Bud. My brother was sent to the front lines about the time
        he should have been graduating from high school. They had an empty seat
        for him at his graduation. There were so many that did not come back, the ones
        that did, never regained their place in the life that they left, before going in
        the service. They paid a high price for freedom, the world changed for them.
        There is a poem written by his niece, Sandra Shields on the <a

        <strong>Merriam, Wheeler G. BG : ( </strong>15
        April 1911-- 12 Feb.1997 ) He was born in North Brookfield, Mass. son of Burr T.
        and Corinne ( Pease ) Merriam, attended local schools, received a bachelor's
        degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Maine in 1932, and
        received a master's degree in education from Harvard University in 1940. Gen.
        Merriam joined the U.S. Army in 1932 and received a reserve commission as a 2nd
        Lieutenant in the infantry. He was called to active duty in August 1940 as part
        of the 82nd Reconnaissance Battalion, and led the 82nd through France, Belgium,
        Holland, Germany.. His was the first U.S. Army unit to encounter Soviet troops
        at the Elbe river in Germany, which ended the advance of the U. S. forces in
        Europe in World War 11. Col. Merriam as we knew him was affectionately referred
        to as &quot; Mother Merriam &quot;, he seemed to always be looking out for our
        welfare, always wanted to be sure that we were as safe as we could be, which was
        a hard job in combat. Hassselt, Belgium has just named a street after him. He
        was a good commanding officer of the 82nd. He was a <strong>World War 11 hero</strong>
        to everyone and to the men that served under him. After the war, he headed the
        general instruction department of the Cavalry School at Ft. Riley, KS. In 1947,
        he entered the Army's Command and General Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth, then
        went to the Army War College. He was promoted to colonel in 1953 and was
        assigned as secretary to the United Nations Armistice Commission at Panmunjoin,
        Korea, where he was responsible for administration of the site and planning for
        the truce negotiations involving the United Nations, North Korea and China. In
        1954, Gen. Merriam was promoted to the rank of brigadier general, and in 1964
        was assigned to the 3rd Armored Division in Germany as assistant division
        commander of maneuvers. During his military career, he was awarded the Silver
        Star with one oak leaf cluster, the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star with two oak
        leaf clusters, the Croix de Guerre with palm for action in both Belgium and
        France, the Fouragere Belgium, and Hero of the Soviet Union. Gen. Merriam was a
        charter member and past president of the 2nd Armored Division Association.

        After retiring from the army in 1966, he
        started a second career in higher education. He moved to Jaffrey and joined
        Franklin Pierce College in Rindge as dean of students. During his years at
        Franklin Pierce, he started the counseling department, developed and outing
        club, and built up the student center. He also helped to convert a campus

        <strong>Montgomery, Bernard, Gen.:</strong> (1987-1976)
        Montgomery's willfulness, egocentricity and arrogance were dominant traits of
        his character as young officer. Despite this he rose to rank of general and
        became Commander of the 3rd Division, which he took to France in 1939 and then
        evacuated from Dunkirk, battered but still intact, in June 1940. He was one of
        the last officer's to leave the beach at Dunkirk. Then on to command the V and
        V11 Corps in 1942, chosen to command the Eighth Army in the western desert. He
        took over an army that had just received an infusion of modern equipment and
        reinforcements. He was the first British commander to defeat a German force. He
        did a good job at at El Alamein in Africa. Gen. Montgomery was to close the
        Falaise Gap, in Aug. 1944, he changed his instructions on what division's were
        to take the duty five times,. His inconsistency on the Falaise Gap showed his
        lack of will to make a firm decision on just how he was going to trap the
        Germans, and not allow them to escape toward the Seine River. The Ardennes
        Offensive: 1. He wanted to pull back from the Elsenborn Ridge even as the battle
        was almost won, but bowed to Gen. Hodges objection. 2. He wanted to pull back
        immediately from St.Vith, which would have afforded the Germans early use of a
        vital road network but bowed to Gen. Hodges objection. Hodges had already
        specified that that decision was to be made by the man on the ground, Hasbrouck.
        3. He ordered the 82nd Airborne Div. to withdraw from the Salm River to Trois
        Ponts-Manhay line, but Ridgeway had already directed Gen. Gavin to prepare for
        such a withdrawal. 4. He ordered relinquishing the Manhay crossroads, but in
        recognition that opened another route of the Germans to the Ourthe River, Hodges
        ordered the crossroads to be retaken. 5. He ordered Joe Collins to assemble for
        an attack, but when most of Collins force became involved in the defensive
        battle, authorized withdrawal. Collins attacked instead and stopped the Germans
        short of the Meuse. 6. When it came to reducing the bulge, he used great skill
        and less tact. Montgomery moved so slowly-however &quot;surely&quot;--that the
        Germans were able to regroup undisturbed by the First Army for new assaults on
        Bastogne. 7. Every division of the Ninth Army that was sent to the Ardennes, was
        sent before Montgomery assumed command. Later Gen. Montgomery requested that the
        2nd Armored be sent to the Ardennes 14 Offensive. On 12 Sept. 1944, General
        Harmon took command of the division and by Oct. 1944 we had crossed the Meuse
        River, pierced the Siegfried Line, and were in the vicinity of Eubach, Germany,
        where we were ordered to halt. We were having great difficulty getting gasoline
        to run our vehicles. What we did not know was that all of our gas supply had
        been diverted to the big mistake called the Market Garden operation which
        Montgomery was running in the northern part of Holland, he was trying to capture
        all of the bridges before the Germans blew them up. This operation not only
        drained all of our supplies, but all of Patton's and the First Army and our own
        Ninth Army to which we had been transferred. We also lost more men that we had
        lost on D-Day, and we accomplished nothing. Because of this fiasco in Northern
        Holland we were forced to remain inactive for about five weeks. When the war
        ended he was selected to accept the surrender of the Germans in the Northern
        region of Europe. After he war he was the Chief of the Imperial General Staff
        and Deputy Supreme Allied Commander of Europe.

        <strong>Patton Jr., George Smith, (General, &quot;Blood
            and Guts&quot;):</strong>(11 Nov. 1885 to 21 Dec. 1945)<strong> </strong>Born in
        San Gabriel, California, Patton then spent one year at Virginia Military
        Institute, while there he decided to obtain a commission in the army. Patton was
        commissioned in the cavalry after his 1909 graduating from the US Military
        Academy. He gained a reputation for his ability, energy, marksmanship, and
        superb horsemanship in his early years.. Patton was a pioneer in many areas. In
        1912 he represented the United States Military and was the first American to
        compete in the Modern Pentathlon, an event stressing horsemanship, in the
        Olympic Games held in Stockholm, Sweden. Immediately after the he attended the
        French Cavalry school in Samur, France. He wrote the Army Manuel on the Saber,
        while he was at Ft. Riley, Kansas while serving there as an instructor in the
        mounted Service School. Patton was promoted to captain in 1917, after
        participating in General John L. Pershing's Punitive Expedition into Mexico.(
        trying to hunt down Pancho Villa in 1916). Following his promotion, he joined
        Gen. Pershing's staff in the American Expeditionary Force in May 1917, and was
        sent to France. By that time a temporary lieutenant colonel ( Note later
        reverted to captain at Ft. Meade, Maryland ) in World War I, He became the first
        member of the Tank Corps and organized the First American Tank Training Center
        at Langres, France. Patton organized and commanded the 304th Tank Brigade during
        the St. Mihiel and the Meuse Argonne offensive. This was one of two battalion
        which provided the bulk of the officers and men of the &quot;old 66th&quot;. In
        an engagement, General Patton led his battalion into action seated atop the
        turret of a two-man Renault tank. A knee wound suffered in a previous action
        prevented him from getting inside. The tank punched through the enemy &amp;
        fixed position but the infantry given the mission of following the tanks in
        close support, had fallen too far behind, General Patton personally went back,
        located the troops, gave them a sample of his choice of words and brought them
        up to take over the ground his tanks had over run. He received the Distinguished
        Service Cross and the Purple Heart during the Meuse Offensive.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the war he returned to the United States and was
        reverted from temporary colonel to captain and then in 1919 he was promoted to
        Major and commanded the 304th Tank Bn. at Ft. Meade, Maryland. Over the next 20
        years served with the 3rd Cav. at Ft. Myer, Virginia, two tours in Hawaii and
        was in the office of the Chief of Cavalry in 1928-31. Graduated from the Cavalry
        School, Ft. Riley, Kansas in 1923. Graduated from the Command and General Staff
        School, Ft. Leavenworth in 1924, Army War College in 1932. Was promoted to
        lieutenant colonel in 1934, and then to colonel in 1937. From December 1938 to
        July 1940 commanded the 3rd Cavalry at Ft. Myers, Virginia. Then was assigned to
        the 2nd Armored in Ft. Benning Georgia. He advanced to temporary brigadier
        general in Oct. 1940, in April 1941 he became the divisional commander with the
        temporary rank of major general. There and later at the army's Desert Training
        Center ( which he commanded during April-August 1942 ) on the California-Arizona
        border he molded the 2nd, and from Jan. 1942 the I Armored Corps into a highly
        efficient force.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gen. Patton headed the Western Task Force to take part in
        the North African campaign in November 1942. Took command of the II Corps in
        Tunisia in March 1943 becoming lieutenant general in April. He did a great job
        in restoring discipline and morale, and making them ready for combat in the II
        Corps. Was in on the invasion of Sicily, this would be code named
        &quot;Operation Husky&quot;. During the days before the invasion of Sicily Gen.
        Patton was going by a group of men trying to float a bridge into the shore near
        Arzew from an LST. Some of the men were falling off into the water, and they
        seemed to be enjoying it, Gen. Patton seeing that the platoon leader an officer
        was the only dry man in the platoon, ordered him into the water. He told the
        officer that if his men are dripping wet he should be too. Later would become
        involved incident of the slapping of a hospitalized soldier whom he suspected of
        malingering. He was reprimanded by General Eisenhower, and unduly criticized in
        the press. We have to remember that at that time the understanding of combat
        fatigue and stress related to combat action was not fully understood as it is
        today. He did later apologize. As a result of this his promotion to a higher
        rank was held up for several months. Early in November 1944 he was ordered to
        England to take command of the Third Army.
    </p>
    <p>
        Gen. George S. Patton Jr., known as &quot;Old Blood and
        Guts&quot; was one of the most colorful commanders in the US Army. The famed
        commander of the Third Army during World War II displayed courage and daring as
        prominently as the pair of ivory handled revolvers he wore. In the early part of
        World War II, Patton played a major role in the North Africa and Sicily
        Campaigns. But he is best remembered for his command of the Third Army during
        its drive across France. The Third Army pushed through the German defenses and
        captured thousands of prisoners before being forced to stop, due to a lack of
        logistical support, at the Seine and Meuse Rivers. Gen.Patton accomplished one
        of the most remarkable feats in military history in December 1944, when he
        quickly turned the Third Army northward to reinforce the Allied southern flank
        against the German attack in the Battle of the Bulge. (Ardennes Offensive) In
        Dec. 1944 poised on the Saar, he executed one of the most remarkable pieces of
        staff work and field maneuver in military history by quickly turning the Third
        Army northward to shore up the Allied southern flank against the German Ardennes
        Offensive, known also as &quot; The Battle of the Bulge ).The Third Army's 4th
        Armored Division, spearheaded by Creighton Abrams 37th Tank Battalion, rescued
        and relieved the &quot;Battered Bastards of Bastogne,&quot; the 101 Airborne
        Division. <strong>General Patton would review his beloved 2nd Armored Division
            one more time in July of 1945 in Berlin, Germany. And yes, he was wearing his
            famous pistols, he stood out as an impressive figure. The 82nd Reconnaissance,
            as a part of the 2nd Armored Division stood for this review, as he passed by in
            a half-track. This was a moment in history for all of us in the 2nd Armored
            Division. He was a great general.</strong>

        General Patton's doctrines for aggressive employment of
        massive Armor forces continue to prove themselves in combat areas around the
        world. <strong>The members of the 2nd Armored Division credit the intense
            training and the readiness that Gen. Patton required of his troops as the reason
            that the they suffered less casualties than other armored divisions. Even with
            much more combat time in action. The 2nd Armored Division was best trained
            armored division in World War 2.</strong> He was a &quot;spit and polish
        soldier&quot; he became on of the most brilliant decisive and aggressive
        military commanders in American History. After the war his public criticisms of
        the post-war denazification program in occupied Germany, based on apprehensions
        of Communist takeovers in Europe, led to his being transferred in Oct. 1945 from
        command of the Third Army and the military governorship of Bavaria to a largely
        paper Fifteenth Army. In this post he was president of Theater General Board,
        organized to study the European campaign. In November replaced Gen. Eisenhower
        as commander of US Forces in Europe. After only two weeks in this position as a
        result of a car accident he passed away on 21 Dec. 1945 in Heidleberg, Germany.
        At his own request, he is buried alongside fallen comrades in the American
        Cemetery at Hamm, Luxembourg. General Patton no doubt at times was over anxious
        to move his troops forward, when it was best for him to slow down. ( so
        everybody else could catch up ) He was the ultimate soldier, his understanding
        of war and how to conquer the enemy was outstanding, there was none better.
        General Patton was dedicated, devout, profane, flamboyant and sometimes
        controversial. He was a man for this time and a true <strong>American Hero</strong>.

        Gen. Rose became Chief of Staff of the 2nd Armored Div.,
        in January-Feb. 1942 for a short period of time. Then in late Feb. as a Colonel
        was assigned as a Chief of Staff of the 1st Armored Div. while in the Kasserine
        Pass area in Africa. General Rose was in the drive to retake Kasserine Pass, and
        he stuck it out at an advance observation post despite heavy enemy fire. The
        battling in Bizerte, Africa permitted no lull for negotiations for surrender.
        Then with the rank of colonel, General Rose took a vehicle through enemy lines
        to a German command post and arranged for the capitulation of the 15th Panzer
        Division. Except for a brief duty with the 2nd Armored in February and March
        1942, served with the 1st Armored until the German capitulation in North Africa.
        In Sicily while the tanks of his command attacked the town of Canicatti, Sicily
        on the third day of the invasion, he pushed ahead to arrange for the town's
        surrender. German artillery opened fire on the General's jeep (Peep), General
        Rose and then Col. Sidney Hinds spent a precarious 20 minutes reaching the
        safety of a defiled position where he waited until his tanks came up. In May
        1943, returned as Commander of Combat Command &quot;A,&quot; which the 2nd
        Armored Div. was part of, was promoted to brigadier general. He served in that
        capacity until he was given command of 3rd Armored Div. on 6 Aug.1944 in France.
        General Maurice Rose was killed outside of Hamborn, Germany, 30 March 1945
        while leading a column of the 3rd Armored. <strong>He
            was a tough, strict soldier, harsh at times, but a man with a dash and daring
            who won the admiration of his men. He was not afraid to go to the front of the
            column. He started at the bottom and was able to achieve all of the above, he
            was a real World War 11 hero</strong>. His wife was Miss. Virginia Barringer.
        They have a son Maurice Roderick Rose, born Jan. 1941. .General Maurice Rose had
        two (2) sons -- both named Maurice, as the result of two (2) marriages. The
        first to Venice Hanson and the second to Virginia Barringer. The first son.
        Maurice Rose retired from the US Marine Corps after 31 years of active duty as a
        Colonel. The second son named Maurice
        Roderick Rose is named after General Roderick Allen. Both are alive today. <a

        <b>Smith, Harold D., Capt.:</b> (14
        May 1916 to 13 Sept. 1944). Harold D. Smith was born in Stillwater, Oklahoma. He
        attended A&amp;M College in Tucson, Arizona, and was inducted into the army at
        Fort Bliss, Texas, 2 Feb. 1941. He participated in the Louisiana maneuvers held
        from 9 Aug. 1941 to 3 Oct. 1941. Then he attended Officer Candidate School at
        Fort Knox, Kentucky, where he received his commission in Jan.1942. He served
        under General Patton in Africa and Sicily. Captain Smith<u>,</u> as a 1st
        Lieutenant, landed in North Africa on 8 Nov. 1942. Lt. Smith was assigned to the
        1st Armored Div. at Maknassy (was connected to the battle for Kasserine Pass)
        which was slightly north east of El Guettar, and south east of Kasserine Pass in
        Tunisia. He moved directly into action with &quot;B&quot; Co., 13th A.R. in an
        observer capacity. His post was on the southern section of the battle of Kas<u>s</u>erine
        Pass in March 1943. Also served as Liaison Officer to the 2nd Battalion of the
        18th Inf. at Beja. Lt. Smith earned a commendation during this and subsequent
        actions, and was commended for &quot;his calmness and courage under the most
        dangerous situations, which served as an inspiration to all with whom he came in
        contact.&quot; The commendation goes on to read:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                &quot;In the actions near Beja he was assigned as
                Liaison Officer to the 2nd Battalion of the 18th Infantry. In this capacity,
                he performed his job in a superior manner with utter disregard for his own
                safety, and his timely information contributed greatly to the success of the
                operation. Later, he volunteered to command a platoon going into action when
                all the platoon officers in that particular Company had been killed. Once
                again he proved himself to be a officer of courage and skill who quickly
                gained the support of his men. Such actions on the part of an assigned
                observer I deem highly commendable and deserving of recognition.&quot; /s/

        Lt. Smith went through the Sicilian Campaign, and arrived
        in Tidworth Barracks in England as <u>a</u> member of the 2nd Armored Division
        in Dec.1943. Lt. Smith participated in the Normandy landing and then the
        breakthrough at St. Lo on 27 July 1944. He was awarded the Silver Star for
        gallantry in action while serving in France, was awarded three medals by the
        French Government. During the European action he was a member of the 2nd Armored
        Div.. Capt. Harold D. Smith served under Gen. Edward H. Brooks and Gen. Ernest
        N. Harmon.
    </p>
    <p>
        On 2 Aug.1944, Reconnaissance. Co., 67th A.R. led off as
        the Combat Command &quot;B&quot;, with Capt. Smith as Commanding Officer, moving
        to block the escape routes into the interior of France of the German Seventh
        Army elements. In the action near St. Sever Calvados, all platoons were involved
        in the first contact by the Combat Command &quot;B&quot;. The first supported an
        attack of the 28th Inf. on a hill near the Vire highway while the third,
        supported by the mortars of the first and third under 1st Sergeant Lee, took a
        hill from which there had been a good deal of enemy fire. Both platoons advanced
        toward a strong enemy position with a platoon of mediums from &quot;D&quot;
        Company attached<u>,</u> and were met by fierce enemy fire of all kinds, direct
        artillery, mortar, bazooka<u>,</u> and small arms. They could not retain the
        position. In the withdrawing, Capt. Smith, working in a defile in the center of
        many of the wounded, lifted them to the back of the armored cars before they
        moved out. Tank and infantry casualties were higher than those of the Company.
        Seiler was killed and Sgt. Mosco and Cpl. Fee were injured. Capt. Smith and Sgt.
        William J. Huffman were the last to leave the scene, and they surprised the
        Company by getting out safely at all. Capt. Smith was awarded the Distinguished
        Service Cross for his heroism in this action. The reconnaissance objection of
        the action was reached in the next days by the third platoon when it made
        contact with the 3rd Armored Div. and passed through their outposts along the
        route, which was followed by the combat command in its flanking movement to
        Barenton. The advance drew to a halt in the Marchioness area for lack of gas.
        The Executive's half-track was completely dry at the main crossroads of
        Marchioness; gas was borrowed from the division G-3 to move it to the Company
        assembly area at Landaus. Before assembling at Landaus on 3 Sept. 1944 the First
        had had a patrol into Belgium. Capt. Smith’s car captured the division
        commander during that fast moving time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Three days were passed here, and they were the days of
        highest optimism. The Company received orders that carried to the Siegfried
        Line. Capt. Smith, who had never before expressed high hopes, told the Company
        that he hoped and expected the next formation to be after victory. The captured
        aviation gas was issued and the Belgian border was crossed. 1st Inf. and 3rd
        Armored Div. positions were passed through at Mons and two days spent at Ulbeek.
        For the first time the command post was indoors. The Company moved out of Ulbeek
        on Capt. Smith's own order and went up to Beverat where the artillery was in
        position without protection. While the Division was lined up on the Albert Canal
        and the Maas (Meuse) River, the Company reconnoitered for bridges and possible
        bridge sights and protected the approaches from the far side.
    </p>
    <p>
        On 13 Sept. 1944, Capt. Smith led a reconnaissance patrol
        toward the bank of the Albert Canal, observed an artillery mission on enemy
        across the Canal, and was hit in the heart by a sniper round. He died almost
        instantly. He was awarded the Purple Heart, and is interred in Henri-Chapelle
        U.S. Military Cemetery, Belgium.. Captain Harold D. Smith was a leader of men
        and an inspiration to the men in his Company. He was a World War II hero.

        <strong>Sorensen Sr, Ernest G., PFC. :</strong>( 23 April 1929 -
        2 Nov. 1995 ). Ernest G. Sorensen was born in Archer, Iowa. He entered the army
        around 1961, and was stationed at Ft. Hood Texas for a while and then
        participated in the &quot;Operation Big Lift&quot;. This was to supply food and
        supplies that were needed by the people of Berlin, Germany to survive the Soviet
        blockade of that city during the Cold War. He and other soldiers stood at
        attention for hours on the Tarmac at Templehof Airport in Berlin, Germany the
        day that President Kennedy was assassinated. Later on returning to Ft. Hood,
        Texas, he repaired and drove tanks. He was a member of the 2nd Armored Division
        while there.

    <p>
        After leaving the military and going to
        back to Oklahoma to live as a civilian he became active in re-enactment's of the
        American Civil War and founder of The First Wright County Light Artillery.
        He was a skilled machinist who built a full size 3 inch Ordnance Rifle and a
        Mountain Howitzer, both from copies of the original blue prints from the
        1860's. He christened the Ordnance Rifle '<strong>Hell on Wheels'</strong>
        on 11 Aug. 1984 and went on to win many local and national contests for accuracy
        as well as participating in battle re-enactment's and historical presentations
        in cooperation with the regional Historical Societies. He was also a
        skilled gunsmith, a collector of antique weapons, and a recognized as an
        authority on building and maintaining replica artillery pieces. He
        continued to be an active participant even after and accident caused him the
        loss of his left leg. This loss lent itself to his playing the role of' a
        &quot; battlefield casualty &quot;, and with the help of a another gentleman
        portraying a doctor, he was the victim of many mock amputations to the horror
        and delight of the spectators. He
        was buried in the uniform of a 2nd Lieutenant of the Artillery of the Grand Army
        of the Republic, with full military honors befitting an officer of that
        time. Including an Honor Guard and a 21 gun salute. He is sadly
        missed and will be long remembered by his friends and family. Every life has a
        story and all to many of them are lost to the ages.
