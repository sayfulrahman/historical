    <font face="Verdana"><strong>A story with humor: </strong>General
        S,,,, told this story: One night Patton came in with a bottle of brandy and
        said, &quot; Let's have a nightcap. &quot; We drank and talked. Patton said.
        &quot; Well, here we all are under Eisenhower and Bradley, both six years our
        junior. Hodges flunked out of West Point Class of ought-eight and had to enlist
        and now he commands First Army. I was turned back from ought -eight. and it took
        me five years to graduate- with ought-nine-but I command Third Army. You came
        out 2nd from the bottom in our class in ought-nine and you command Ninth Army.
        Isn't it peculiar that three old farts like us should be carrying the ball for
        those two son-of-b,,,,,?&quot;.</font>

</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">&quot;I strongly object to the fact that this
        stupid operation in the Ardennes is sometimes called the 'Rundstedt offensive'.
        This is a complete misnomer. I had nothing to do with it. It came to me as an
        order complete to the last detail. Hitler had even written on the plan in his
        own handwriting &quot; not to be altered.&quot; (Field-Marshall Von Rundstedt)</font>

    <font face="Verdana"><strong>Winston Churchill</strong> before the

        Soft Underbelly&quot; meaning that it would not prove to be hard for the Allies
        to overrun Italy. This understatement would become a grim joke, Italy proved to
        be a hard fight and have a jagged edge.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">22 June 1941:<strong> Hitler </strong>said
        over the German radio: &quot; I have decided again today,&quot; is to place the
        fate and future of the Reich and our people in the hands of our soldiers&quot;.

    <font face="Verdana">In Roosevelt's address to Congress on 6
        January 1941, he set forth the cause of the democracies in these immortal words:
        &quot; In the future days which we seek to make secure, we look forward for a
        world founded upon the four essential human freedoms. The <strong>first</strong>
        is freedom of speech and expression-everywhere in the world, The <strong>second</strong>
        is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way-everywhere in the
        world. The <strong>third </strong>is freedom from what you want-which,
        translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to
        every nation a healthy peaceful life for its inhabitants-everywhere in the
        world. The <strong>fourth</strong> is freedom from fear-which, translated into
        world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in
        such a thorough fashion, that no nation will be in a position to commit an act
        of aggression against any neighbor-anywhere in the world.</font>

<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana"><b>Good Question:</b> Sgt. Kilroy you
        volunteered, would you do it if you had it all to do over.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana"><b>Answer:</b> Yes,&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana"><b>Why?</b>&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana"><b>Answer: </b>At that time all my friends
        were going, it was a time when most everyone was patriotic, of course there were
        some draft dodgers even then, and claims of problems to stay out of the service,
        but generally most wanted to serve, it was a different time. But there came a
        time, on our first combat mission,&nbsp; when I looked down into the valley that
        we were headed for and seen all the shooting down there,&nbsp; then I wondered
        &quot; <b>what the hell am I doing here&quot; </b>Those were not good
        days.&nbsp;</font>

<p align="left"><strong>
        <font face="Verdana">Questions: Have you
            heard that the 2nd Armored is being resurrected?</font>
    </strong></p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana"><strong>Answer: </strong>Yes it is,
        for use by the National Guard units. this reported in December that they will be
        a part of the III Corps at either Ft. Carson, CO. or Fort Riley, KA., both under
        the command of the III Corps. also the 24th Infantry is under similar orders.
        They will be under the command of a 2 Star General. This a new and changing
        army.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Did you take basic training like
        the other men that entered the army ?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: yes and no, I was immediately shipped
        to the Cavalry in Kansas and worked in the stables for 3 months, and done some
        close order drill and learned how to ride a horse.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: who do you consider to be the
        outstanding <strong>Allied General'</strong>s of WW 2 ?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: This is a hard question, there are so
        many that it would be an injustice to just name a few, and leave other's out
        that I consider to be just as good. I always wondered why nobody ever asked what
        are the names of some <strong>great privates</strong>, they were out there too,
        they were even up front fighting the enemy. (I said great, not somebody <strong>famous</strong>) When the
        enemy gets you in his sights he don't care if you are
        outstanding, or great, or famous, he shoots to kill.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Did you like the food in the army ?</font>

</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Did you like the British people ?.
        Did you think that Winston Churchill was a great leader of the English people
        during World War 2 ?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: yes to both questions.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Did you like the German people?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: Not while we were in combat, they put
        Hitler in power, we didn't, so they must share the blame for the mistreatment
        and death of many Jewish people. Also for all the other lives that were lost in
        World War 2. Don't forget all the people that lost everything, homes, property,
        the lives of their loved ones. You can't bring back what we lost, its all gone,
        but we can be sure that this will not happen again for us and our children and
        their children.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Do you think that the government of
        <strong>Switzerland</strong> has been forthright in the disclosure of their part
        in receiving stolen assets from the Nazi during WW 2?
    </font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: No I do not, they have failed to
        convince me that they held an honorable position during the war years, too much
        underhanded maneuvering here. We need a full disclosure on all of the stolen
        assets that passed into that country, they should be held accountable. You can
        claim to be neutral, but then you must be neutral. Also our country should
        divulge, when they knew and what they knew about this.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Did you like your army boots,
        issued to you overseas?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: The raw rough ones, the leather was
        so stiff it rubbed your ankles, it never did get any softer. Whatever the army
        paid for these boots it was too much. They were miserable, they never got any
        better..</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Were you paid very good?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: No, but then we had no place to spend
        it</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Was it cold in the Ardennes?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">

        and January.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Can you describe combat?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: I do not think that anyone can do

<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Do you think that they should be

<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: do you think that women should take
        basic training with men?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: No, trained, then assigned to
        whatever branch they are best suited for, just like the men.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Why don't you have any Women's Army
        Corps. history listed on your 2nd Armored units page, surely there were women in
        the 2nd Armored Division.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: No one has stepped forward, we
        welcome all, don't forget all the nurses, the Red Cross, the USO, and the women
        on the home front.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Did they give you earplugs in basic
        training, when you were at the firing range?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: No, that is why almost all WW 2
        veterans have trouble hearing.</font>
</p>

</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Did you have training on the weapon
        you carried in combat?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: No, but sure learned real quick in
        combat.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Question: Did you ever wonder what you were
        fighting for?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana">Answer: Sometimes, but who cares when you are
        being shot at by everything the enemy has including artillery, you name it.
        you're thinking about just surviving at that moment, the hell with tomorrow.</font>
</p>
<p align="left">

        army buddies?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana"><b>Answer: </b>Generally if I go to a

</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana"><b>Question:</b> Do you talk about the old
        times, and the times you were in&nbsp; combat ?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana"><b>Answer:</b> Yes we do sometimes, but it is
        sometimes hard to talk about those days, they were emotional periods of
        time,&nbsp; and we still have a very vivid memory of the events,&nbsp; where we
        lost members in combat, it is generally the case that we try to talk about some
        of the good times we had. And we had them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana"><b>Question:</b> Did you ever go back , to
        the countries you went through on your advance to Berlin?</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana"><b>Answer: </b>Yes a few times, the last in
        September of 1999. I dedicated that trip to the mission of seeing if I could get
        some of the towns and villages in France and Belgium and Holland&nbsp; to erect
        memorials to the men of our unit that gave their lives&nbsp; so that we could
        all enjoy the freedom we have today. I especially wanted their names to be known
        to all,&nbsp;&nbsp; even though they are not here, we must never forget, and
        especially the generations now and later will know that someone died to keep us
        free.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana"><b>Question:</b> Do you like war
        correspondents?</font>
</p>
<p align="left"><b>
        <font face="Verdana">Answer: No.</font>
    </b></p>
<p align="left">
    <font face="Verdana"><b>Why? </b>Mostly because I never seen many
        that were not all wrapped up in warm fur lined jackets and trousers and boots,
        we were freezing,&nbsp; they were warm and they got paid a lot more money than
        us and could stay in a warm place at night almost every night. So most of
        them,&nbsp; no I do not care for. You might say well that is way it goes, well
        it can go that way and I still don't like most of them.&nbsp;</font>
