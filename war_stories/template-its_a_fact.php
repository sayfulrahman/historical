        assigned on a number of occasions during WWII. &amp; much of the

        Divisions During the race across Northern France, Belgium and Holland in Sept.
        1944The battalion bridged the Albert Canal to allow the Armor to break into
        Germany. The Battalion was then assigned to the 2nd Armored from the
        middle of October until the 2nd was transferred to the 1st Army, to fight in
        the Bulge, in mid December 1944 . The 2nd Armored spearheaded the
        breakout across the Rhine and we worked with the 17th Engineers bridging every
        river along the way. At the Elbe river we took the 41st infantry across
        the river to establish the bridgehead and then worked with the 17th Engineers in
        a futile attempt to get a bridge and ferry across the river. I

        <strong><u>Stolen Valor:</u> </strong>Fake war veterans
        have showed up in the aftermath of all wars. This always happens, to list one:
        Tom Mix, western star in over 93 films, had a phony war record presented for the
        publics consumption. He claimed honors and wounds from Cuba (1898), Philippines
        (1899), and China (1900) along with the Boer War in Africa. (never in any of
        these) Tom Mix in real life only served in the U.S., in artillery units. All his
        claims about being shot and this and that, he was only shot one time by his
        wife, and that was during an argument. Even the VFW accepted him as a member
        based on all the hype about him being in all the wars listed above. There are
        more of these fake medal wearers, and ones that make claims to heroics acts that
        are blatantly untrue. &quot; Its a Fact &quot;

        <strong><u>Old Glory:</u> THE OLD GLORY STORY<br>
        </strong>To veterans throughout American history, the Stars and Stripes has
        served as a symbol of their service and as a continuing testimony that the
        service is worthwhile. Since many flags of early America contained stripes
        in their design and several others had stars, there are varying accounts of when
        and where the first Stars and Stripes was flown. Flag history
        experts agree, however, that the first Stars and Stripes flag to have the
        general form we recognize today did not appear until the summer of 1777, when
        the Continental Congress formally resolved: &quot;That the flag of the United
        States be 13 stripes, alternate read and white, that the union be 13 white stars
        in a blue field representing a new constellation. Interestingly, the Congress
        did not specify the arrangement or shape of the stars, the direction of the
        stripes, or the relative size of the various components Consequently,
        military units and civilian public alike flew a confusing array of local, state
        and home-made interpretations of the Congressional flag description. It was not
        until 1912 that the flag was finally assured a uniform appearance, when
        President Taft signed an executive order prescribing the relative size, shape,
        and positioning of the Flag's components. A subject of almost as much debate as
        the shape ad design of the flag has been the question of how and when to display
        the Stars and Strips.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since 1942, when a law was first enacted to govern actual
        display he flag, the guiding statement has been that the flag should be flown on
        &quot;days when weather permits.&quot; The generally excepted
        interpretation was that the colors could be shown only between sunrise and
        sundown, and, even then, not during inclement weather. Growing sentiment that
        &quot;Old Glory&quot; should be kept flying irrespective of darkness and foul
        weather culminated in 1976, when President Ford signed legislation providing
        that&quot; &quot;When a patriotic effect is desired, the flag may be
        displayed twenty-four hours a day if properly illuminated during the hours
        of darkness.&quot; The new law also permits the Stars and Stripes to
        remain flying through inclement weather when a flag of all-weather material is
        used. In addition to its historical significance for permitting the
        national colors to remain aloft indefinitely for patriotic effect, the 1976
        legislation may be remembered for giving life to &quot;Old Glory&quot;.
        The new flag code contains the provision that&quot; &quot;The flag represents a
        loving country and is itself considered a living thing.&quot;. &quot;Its A
        Fact&quot; Thanks! Sharon.

    <p><b><u>Flag Trivia: </u></b><i>Little known Flag Trivia as follows:</i></p>
    <p>
        1. During the manufacture of the flag, the material left over is never
        allowed to fall upon the floor. It always falls into containers.]
    </p>
    <p>
        2. The flag planted on the moon is made of nylon and set
        in an aluminum frame.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Miniature flags of the 50 United States and 124 United Nations were
        carried to the moon by the astronauts and brought back to Earth. These flags
        were distributed by President Nixon to the governors of the states and to the
        heads of members of the United Nations.

        4.The entire top of the flagpole is called a truck. There are many items that
        can rightfully be called a truck: ball, flat, star, halberd, eagle.

        <strong><u>&quot;Lady Be Good&quot;:</u></strong><u> </u>On
        9 November 1958, a B-24 bomber was discovered by as British oil reconnaissance
        crew, 385 miles due south of Tobruk, Libya. This was a site in the Northern
        Libya desert, in the war zone. The Air Corps serial # , 41-24301, taken from the
        plane, was sent to St. Louis for identification. The plane christened &quot; The
        Lady Be Good &quot; by parties unknown, had a crew assigned to it on 17 February
        1943. Lt. Millard Kesler, a Hillsboro, Ohio native was the assigned navigator.
        The Air Force officer in charge of records at St. Louis knew Lt. Kesler, and
        that he was at Wright Patterson Air Base in Dayton, Ohio.
    </p>
    <p>
        When contacted Lt. Kesler gave the history of
        the &quot; Lady Be Good &quot;. Kesler said he and the rest of the crew assigned
        in 1943 were awaiting take off time to proceed on their and the plane's first
        mission when those fabulous WW 11 Gremlins &quot; went to work. Multiple engine
        mal-functions. They just could not get all the engines to run. In 1943 a, a full
        air crew was not going to stand around long, idle. The crew was reassigned to a
        reserve bomber which was about one step away from the junk yard, and given a
        different assignment. The &quot; Gremlins&quot; bring banished. &quot;The Lady
        Be Good&quot; took on a new crew, this also being their first mission, and
        departed for North Africa. This is the last time the plane and its crew was seen
        for sixteen years. The poem below written by Neil

        <b>Lady Be Good: New update12 April
            2000. By Maj. Dale Rosenburg , Air Combat Command<br>
        </b><br>
        I was watching the history channel the other day and ran across a very
        interesting documentary entitled, &quot;Ghost Plane of the Desert: Lady Be
        Good.&quot; It focused on the disappearance, and later discovery, of a B-24D
        Liberator lost during World War II.<br>
        The aircraft departed from a base in Soluch, Libya, in April 1943, as part of a
        25-aircraft package intending to strike Naples, Italy. About three-quarters of
        the way to the target, the group aborted the mission due to poor weather. When
        the aircraft aborted, they broke formation and came back as single ships. All
        the aircraft returned, except the Lady Be Good.<br>
        The last known radio transmission from the Lady Be Good was a request to the
        home field for a radio course indication. After being several hours overdue, it
        was assumed the Lady Be Good was down, and search aircraft were dispatched to
        search for wreckage at sea. None was ever found, so it was assumed the Lady Be
        Good had crashed and sank with her crew.<br>
        In 1959, a British Petroleum oil survey crew was looking for oil in the African
        desert 440 miles from Soluch, Libya, where the Lady Be Good had been based. They
        discovered the wreckage of a B-24 which proved to be the Lady Be Good.<br>
        The Air Force dispatched investigators who made some startling discoveries.<br>
        First, none of the crew was in the Lady Be Good when it crashed, nor were their
        remains anywhere near the aircraft. Second, the navigator made no log entries
        after the mission was aborted. Third, the navigator's equipment and charts were
        stored in their cases. At this point, investigators concluded the navigator
        stopped doing his job shortly after they turned back for home.<br>
        Other bomber crews had reported higher than normal tail winds that night, but
        because the Lady Be Good's navigator wasn't doing his job, they flew right over
        their home field and kept on going. Lost and out of fuel, the crew bailed out.
        Several years later BP surveyors located five of the nine crewmembers' remains
        80 miles from the original crash site.<br>
        Surveyors discovered a diary on one of the crew that cleared up many mysteries.
        It told how one crewmember was killed instantly when his parachute failed to
        open. Daily entries described the harsh African desert conditions and the fact
        they had only one-half canteen of water for all of them, and no food.<br>
        Bottom line, the crew tried to walk out of the desert and covered 80 miles in
        eight days before they perished. It would be several years before two more of
        the crew were found about 25 miles from the others. The final crewman has never
        been found and is believed buried by years of blowing sand dunes.<br>
        So why do I tell this story and what lessons can we learn from it? Probably the
        biggest lesson is one that has literally thousands of examples in history:
        complacency has caused more accidents and fatalities than most diseases.<br>
        In the case of Lady Be Good, the crew got complacent about their jobs. Once they
        turned back they were so relieved there was not going to be any shooting that
        turning 180 degrees back to home base would be a cake walk. They let down their
        guard, and in the middle of the biggest shooting war in history, died not from
        bullets or anti-aircraft fire but rather from complacency.<br>
        For those of us in the aircraft maintenance business, there is no more insidious
        enemy than complacency. A crew chief looks over the same airplane day in and day
        out, sometimes several times a day. He or she follows the same checklist until
        they know it by heart.<br>
        How many of you check your car's engine oil at every gas fill up? You figure it
        was good before, so it's good now. And pretty soon you get to the point where
        you never check it; you just wait until the next change is due. You are
        complacent. If your car motor runs out of oil you will need a new engine, but
        it's not life or death.<br>
        However, if an F-16 aircraft engine runs out of oil, most likely the pilot is
        going to have a nylon letdown (ejection).<br>
        My point is you must balance the possible consequences of your actions or
        non-actions with the seriousness of the work to be done. Anytime something
        becomes routine, be aware. Complacency can sneak up and bite you.<br>
        Complacency can have catastrophic effects not just in the aircraft operations
        and maintenance world, but anywhere. The best way I have found to avoid
        complacency is to be aware. Pilots use a term called situational awareness, and
        that is what I mean by being aware.<br>

        <strong><u>Gen. Patton's, 1938 Cadillac:</u></strong> The story is that the car
        had been shipped to France prior to the war and was taken captive by German
        occupation forces when they overran France. It was left behind as the German's
        retreated and was subsequently commandeered by Gen. Patton. The Cadillac was a
        series 75 Fleetwood Model 7533 seven passenger Imperial sedan with a sliding
        glass partition. Records show that some of 479 of this model were produced in
        1938.Gen. Patton was the ultimate soldier faced prospects of a career in
        civilian life with great uncertainty. Indeed he often said! &quot; the proper
        end for the professional soldier is a quick death inflicted by the last bullet
        of the last battle. .&quot; However Gen. Patton met his fate not by that last
        bullet, but while riding in the 1938 Cadillac. Glen. Patton's view of his
        postwar future took an almost death wish aura, which on several occasions in
        1945 were almost fulfilled. These brushes with death included near misses when
        his Piper Cub was mistakenly attacked by an inexperienced Free-Polish pilot
        while flying a RAF Spitfire, his speeding Jeep collided with an oxcart, and a
        minor car accident from which he escaped with minor injuries.

    </p>
    <p>
        On 9 December 1945, Gen. Patton was riding in his Cadillac
        and his driver swerved to miss a truck on a curve, it was at the time thought to
        be a minor accident, but Gen. Patton did not fare well. On 21 December 1945 Gen.
        Patton would die from those injuries. After the accident the car was repaired
        and then used by the Army VIP's until 1951. The repairs were quite interesting.
        While the Cadillac was a 1938 model, the front was restored using parts from
        another 1939 Series 75 car that was found in France. Thus the car now on display
        at the Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor at Ft. Knox is deceiving. It looks
        like a 1939 model, however, the Cadillac buffs quickly see that it is really a
        1938 model. And even the repairs did not duplicate the 1939 model. ( Note: Gen.
        Eisenhower gave Gen. Bradley a 1942 Cadillac to drive in Europe during the
        Belgian Bulge ). &quot; Its a Fact &quot;

        <strong><u>A Military Heritage: </u>( The Internet ) </strong>Many
        people assume the Internet is the brainchild of Silicon Valley. Actually, the
        driving force behind the Internet's creation was the <strong>U.S. Military </strong>during
        the Cold War. 4 October 1957, launch of the satellite<em> Sputnik </em>convinced
        America that its technologies needed beefing up. A key deficiency, military and
        civilian forces couldn't communicate during and after a nuclear war. To find the
        answers to this and other related issues, The Department of Defense launched the
        Advance Research Project Agency (ARPA) to conduct high-tech research. At the
        time, computers were generally seen as big calculators. Not so for one J.C.R.
        Licklider. An MIT professor and one of the ARPA'S early leaders, he envisioned a
        web of inter-connected computers feeding information to each other. Many could
        be destroyed in a nuclear attack, and still the larger communications system
        would remain intact. The idea became a reality in 1969 when four universities
        involved in ARPA projects had their computers connected. By 1972, they were
        sending e-mail to each other. The Internet was born. For more on the military's
        role in creating the Internet, read: &quot; The Ancient History of the

        <strong><u>World War 2, Infantry:</u> </strong>The
        infantry absorbed the greatest number of casualties 80% of Army killed in
        action. In WW 2 there were 68 Combat Divisions deployed in the European Theater
        of Operations. Those infantry, armored, airborne, mountain divisions suffered
        78% of all Army casualties sustained in the theater. Riflemen in the infantry
        divisions suffered 95% of its casualties. &quot; Its A Fact &quot;

        <strong><u>Time in combat:</u></strong><u> </u>Maximum
        time for the average infantryman to be in combat to reach the breaking point 200
        days. infantry men are often referred to as &quot; grunts.&quot; &quot; Its a

        <strong><u>Polish Troops in Italy:</u></strong> At
        the Monastery in Cassino, Italy. Polish troops suffered loss of over 4000 men,
        May of 1944. An inscription reads at the cemetery nearby the following:
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        We Polish solders, For our freedom and
        yours,
    </p>
    <p class="center">

        the soil of Italy,
    </p>
    <p class="center">
        And our hearts to Poland..
    </p>
    <p>
        A tragic loss of Polish lives. The Polish people paid a
        heavy price for the search for freedom, during World War 2 in Europe. The Polish
        civilians were moved around to different places called DP ( displaced people )
        camps in Germany and even their own country.&quot; Its a Fact &quot;

        <strong><u>General Gallieni:</u> He was a French General in WW 1.</strong> Gen. Gallieni ordered gendarmes to
        flag down all the taxis and
        send them to the railroad station and the squares where French troops were
        waiting to go to Marne battlefield to fight and transport the troops to the
        front lines. There was a crucial shortage of troops at the front due to a train
        derailing and not being able to reinforce the beleaguered front line
        troops.&quot; Its A Fact &quot;.

        <strong><u>Ardennes Offensive:</u></strong> In a few
        history books reference is made to the First U.S. Army closing the gap with the
        Third U.S. Army at Houffalize. One such reference is made in the book, &quot; A
        History of the Second United States Armored Division &quot;. This book writes
        that Lt. Baker, &quot;B&quot; Co., 82nd Reconnaissance Battalion , 2nd Armored
        Division met a patrol of the Third Army in the area. Yet another book &quot;
        Second Armored Division History &quot; wrote another story. The facts are as
        follows: <strong>This is the exact words of the Co. &quot;A&quot; morning
            report. Quote:</strong> Achouffe, Belgium, Company remains at present location,
        3rd platoon outposted along the Ourtner river, At 0900A, 16 Jan 1945 the second
        platoon contacted elements of the 11th Armored Div.., thereby closing the gap
        between the 1st U.S. Army and the 3rd U.S. Army, Weather clear and cold, morale
        excellent. Also we have &quot;A&quot; CO's. exact radio transcript which is as
        follows: <strong>Quote: </strong>At 0958A-16 Jan 1945 from Co. &quot;A&quot; to
        Battalion -- We have made contact with the 11th Armored Division, It is their
        Reconnaissance Squadron. The Combat Narrative also reports the same as just
        stated. It was not Lt. Baker from &quot;B&quot; Company it was Lt. Baker from
        &quot;A&quot; Company, his driver also was there Charles Pepe, also others from
        &quot;A&quot; Company's 2nd platoon. &quot; Its A Fact &quot;

        <strong><u>Concentration
                camps:</u> They </strong>were established early in France by the Vichy
        Government.. First Jews left by train for Auschwitz on 27 March 1942, there were
        1112 men aged between 20 and 48, in the first group. This was done by
        Petain&quot;s Vichy Government and you could not disguise the fact that it was a
        legitimate administration set in place by the elected members of both houses of
        parliament. The concentration camp structure and the control of foreigners,
        which later particularly affected Jews, was in place before the war started.
        Thousands of Jews were gathered, and sent to Germany to be put to death. France
        is not an innocent bystander in this tragedy.&quot; Its A Fact &quot; ( For
        more on this go to Armored Forces links

        <strong><u>The Swiss
                government</u></strong><u>: </u>Imprisoned thousands of Jewish refugees
        when they were fleeing Nazi Germany into that country and confined by the Swiss
        in special camps, kept in grim, sometimes cruel conditions behind barbed wire at
        gunpoint and forced to work for little or no pay. Many families were forcibly
        separated by police--including in some cases infants from their mothers, the
        study says, a &quot; special Jew-tax &quot; was levied on rich Jews, but on
        Christians or refugees of other faiths. We accept the facts stated above to be
        true. (excerpts from an article printed the Tampa Tribune, dated January 13,
        1998). This is a current reported story.

        <strong><u>War correspondents, reporters</u>:</strong>
        Press people run around all bundled up in the Ardennes Offensive in peeps
        (jeeps), with drivers and sometimes a cameraman. ( we did not have decent winter
        clothes, most news people wore fur lined overcoats, jackets, and caps) Most
        press people picked the best places to stay in a safe, warm place, generally not
        in a foxhole.( If you had your choice would you stay in a foxhole) They could
        withdraw when the going was rough, we had no choice. I do not ever remember
        seeing one when we were on the move and advancing. At times we were 20 to 60
        miles in front of the main force. The stories looked good in print and they got
        paid well for them. There were many good journalist, there were some not so
        good. &quot; Its a Fact &quot;

        <strong>SOS (Sh-t on a shingle): </strong>Every
        soldier knows about this meal and here is how it is made.<strong> What to do and
            how to cook: </strong>1 /12 teaspoon vegetable oil. 1/2 lb. very lean ground
        beef, 2 large onions (chopped) 1/4 bell pepper (chopped) , put in skillet and
        cook until all is tender, when done, drain liquid off. while this is cooking
        take 3 tablespoons of flour and mix in a glass with cold water, until dissolved,
        add salt and pepper to this just a dash of each . Mix into the meat you have
        just cooked and add 1 additional 1/2 glass of milk and season to taste, (you can
        add a bouillon cube to flavor), stirring constantly, until it thickens, if
        thickens too much add more water to thin some. Toast bread and pour SOS on the
        toast, its good, try it. The above recipes please try at your own risk, if you
        like them tell us, we welcome your comments. The army served a lot of this SOS.

        <strong><u>Fog Oil: </u></strong>A chemical compound
        burned in huge generators that were place in certain positions along the Rhine,
