    <font face="Verdana"><strong><u>Old Glory:</u> THE OLD GLORY STORY<br>
        </strong>To veterans throughout American history, the Stars and Stripes has
        served as a symbol of their service and as a continuing testimony that&nbsp; the
        service is worthwhile.&nbsp; Since many flags of early America contained stripes
        in their design and several others had stars, there are varying accounts of when
        and&nbsp; where the first Stars and Stripes was flown.&nbsp; Flag history
        experts agree, however, that the first Stars and Stripes flag to have the
        general form we recognize today did not appear until the summer of 1777, when
        the Continental Congress formally resolved: &quot;That the flag of the United
        States be 13 stripes, alternate read and white, that the union be 13 white stars
        in a blue field representing a new constellation. Interestingly, the Congress
        did not specify the arrangement or shape of the stars, the direction of the
        stripes, or the relative size of the various components&nbsp; Consequently,
        military units and civilian public alike flew a confusing array of local, state
        and home-made interpretations of the Congressional flag description. It was not
        until 1912 that the flag was finally assured a uniform appearance, when
        President Taft signed an executive order prescribing the relative size, shape,
        and positioning of the Flag's components. A subject of almost as much debate as
        the shape ad design of the flag has been the question of how and when to display
        the Stars and Strips.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font face="Verdana">Since 1942, when a law was first enacted to govern actual
        display he flag, the guiding statement has been that the flag should be flown on
        &quot;days when weather permits.&quot;&nbsp; The generally excepted
        interpretation was that the colors could be shown only between sunrise and
        sundown, and, even then, not during inclement weather. Growing sentiment that
        &quot;Old Glory&quot; should be kept flying irrespective of darkness and foul
        weather culminated in 1976, when President Ford signed legislation providing
        that&quot;&nbsp; &quot;When a patriotic effect is desired, the flag may be
        displayed twenty-four hours a day if properly&nbsp; illuminated during the hours
        of darkness.&quot;&nbsp; The new law also permits the Stars and Stripes to
        remain flying through inclement weather when a flag of all-weather material is
        used.&nbsp; In addition to its historical significance for permitting the
        national colors to remain aloft indefinitely for patriotic effect, the 1976
        legislation may be remembered for giving life to &quot;Old Glory&quot;.&nbsp;
        The new flag code contains the provision that&quot; &quot;The flag represents a
        loving country and is itself considered a living thing.&quot;. &quot;Its A
        Fact&quot; Thanks! Sharon.</font>

        9 November 1958, a B-24 bomber was discovered by as British oil reconnaissance
        crew, 385 miles due south of Tobruk, Libya. This was a site in the Northern
        Libya desert, in the war zone. The Air Corps serial # , 41-24301, taken from the
        plane, was sent to St. Louis for identification. The plane christened &quot; The
        Lady Be Good &quot; by parties unknown, had a crew assigned to it on 17 February
        1943. Lt. Millard Kesler, a Hillsboro, Ohio native was the assigned navigator.
        The Air Force officer in charge of records at St. Louis knew Lt. Kesler, and
        that he was at Wright Patterson Air Base in Dayton, Ohio.</font>

    <font face="Verdana"><b>&nbsp;Lady Be Good: New update12 April
            2000.&nbsp; By Maj. Dale Rosenburg , Air Combat Command<br>
        </b><br>
        I was watching the history channel the other day and ran across a very
        interesting documentary entitled, &quot;Ghost Plane of the Desert: Lady Be
        Good.&quot; It focused on the disappearance, and later discovery, of a B-24D
        Liberator lost during World War II.<br>
        The aircraft departed from a base in Soluch, Libya, in April 1943, as part of a
        25-aircraft package intending to strike Naples, Italy. About three-quarters of
        the way to the target, the group aborted the mission due to poor weather. When
        the aircraft aborted, they broke formation and came back as single ships. All
        the aircraft returned, except the Lady Be Good.<br>
        The last known radio transmission from the Lady Be Good was a request to the
        home field for a radio course indication. After being several hours overdue, it
        was assumed the Lady Be Good was down, and search aircraft were dispatched to
        search for wreckage at sea. None was ever found, so it was assumed the Lady Be
        Good had crashed and sank with her crew.<br>
        In 1959, a British Petroleum oil survey crew was looking for oil in the African
        desert 440 miles from Soluch, Libya, where the Lady Be Good had been based. They
        discovered the wreckage of a B-24 which proved to be the Lady Be Good.<br>
        The Air Force dispatched investigators who made some startling discoveries.<br>
        First, none of the crew was in the Lady Be Good when it crashed, nor were their
        remains anywhere near the aircraft. Second, the navigator made no log entries
        after the mission was aborted. Third, the navigator's equipment and charts were
        stored in their cases. At this point, investigators concluded the navigator
        stopped doing his job shortly after they turned back for home.<br>
        Other bomber crews had reported higher than normal tail winds that night, but
        because the Lady Be Good's navigator wasn't doing his job, they flew right over
        their home field and kept on going. Lost and out of fuel, the crew bailed out.
        Several years later BP surveyors located five of the nine crewmembers' remains
        80 miles from the original crash site.<br>
        Surveyors discovered a diary on one of the crew that cleared up many mysteries.
        It told how one crewmember was killed instantly when his parachute failed to
        open. Daily entries described the harsh African desert conditions and the fact
        they had only one-half canteen of water for all of them, and no food.<br>
        Bottom line, the crew tried to walk out of the desert and covered 80 miles in
        eight days before they perished. It would be several years before two more of
        the crew were found about 25 miles from the others. The final crewman has never
        been found and is believed buried by years of blowing sand dunes.<br>
        So why do I tell this story and what lessons can we learn from it? Probably the
        biggest lesson is one that has literally thousands of examples in history:
        complacency has caused more accidents and fatalities than most diseases.<br>
        In the case of Lady Be Good, the crew got complacent about their jobs. Once they
        turned back they were so relieved there was not going to be any shooting that
        turning 180 degrees back to home base would be a cake walk. They let down their
        guard, and in the middle of the biggest shooting war in history, died not from
        bullets or anti-aircraft fire but rather from complacency.<br>
        For those of us in the aircraft maintenance business, there is no more insidious
        enemy than complacency. A crew chief looks over the same airplane day in and day
        out, sometimes several times a day. He or she follows the same checklist until
        they know it by heart.<br>
        How many of you check your car's engine oil at every gas fill up? You figure it
        was good before, so it's good now. And pretty soon you get to the point where
        you never check it; you just wait until the next change is due. You are
        complacent. If your car motor runs out of oil you will need a new engine, but
        it's not life or death.<br>
        However, if an F-16 aircraft engine runs out of oil, most likely the pilot is
        going to have a nylon letdown (ejection).<br>
        My point is you must balance the possible consequences of your actions or
        non-actions with the seriousness of the work to be done. Anytime something
        becomes routine, be aware. Complacency can sneak up and bite you.<br>
        Complacency can have catastrophic effects not just in the aircraft operations
        and maintenance world, but anywhere. The best way I have found to avoid
        complacency is to be aware. Pilots use a term called situational awareness, and
        that is what I mean by being aware.<br>
        Understand the seriousness of what you are doing and what can happen if it isn't
        done right, even if it seems routine. And if you're not sure about something,
        ask. The answers and experts are out there. (Major Rosenburg is the 57th

        <strong><u>Gen. Patton's, 1938 Cadillac:</u></strong> The story is that the car
        had been shipped to France prior to the war and was taken captive by German
        occupation forces when they overran France. It was left behind as the German's
        retreated and was subsequently commandeered by Gen. Patton. The Cadillac was a
        series 75 Fleetwood Model 7533 seven passenger Imperial sedan with a sliding
        glass partition. Records show that some of 479 of this model were produced in
        1938.Gen. Patton was the ultimate soldier faced prospects of a career in
        civilian life with great uncertainty. Indeed he often said! &quot; the proper
        end for the professional soldier is a quick death inflicted by the last bullet
        of the last battle. .&quot; However Gen. Patton met his fate not by that last
        bullet, but while riding in the 1938 Cadillac. Glen. Patton's view of his
        postwar future took an almost death wish aura, which on several occasions in
        1945 were almost fulfilled. These brushes with death included near misses when
        his Piper Cub was mistakenly attacked by an inexperienced Free-Polish pilot
        while flying a RAF Spitfire, his speeding Jeep collided with an oxcart, and a
        minor car accident from which he escaped with minor injuries.

    <font face="Verdana">On 9 December 1945, Gen. Patton was riding in his Cadillac
        and his driver swerved to miss a truck on a curve, it was at the time thought to
        be a minor accident, but Gen. Patton did not fare well. On 21 December 1945 Gen.
        Patton would die from those injuries. After the accident the car was repaired
        and then used by the Army VIP's until 1951. The repairs were quite interesting.
        While the Cadillac was a 1938 model, the front was restored using parts from
        another 1939 Series 75 car that was found in France. Thus the car now on display
        at the Patton Museum of Cavalry and Armor at Ft. Knox is deceiving. It looks
        like a 1939 model, however, the Cadillac buffs quickly see that it is really a
        1938 model. And even the repairs did not duplicate the 1939 model. ( Note: Gen.
        Eisenhower gave Gen. Bradley a 1942 Cadillac to drive in Europe during the
        Belgian Bulge ). &quot; Its a Fact &quot;</font>

        people assume the Internet is the brainchild of Silicon Valley. Actually, the
        driving force behind the Internet's creation was the <strong>U.S. Military </strong>during
        the Cold War. 4 October 1957, launch of the satellite<em> Sputnik </em>convinced
        America that its technologies needed beefing up. A key deficiency, military and
        civilian forces couldn't communicate during and after a nuclear war. To find the
        answers to this and other related issues, The Department of Defense launched the
        Advance Research Project Agency (ARPA) to conduct high-tech research. At the
        time, computers were generally seen as big calculators. Not so for one J.C.R.
        Licklider. An MIT professor and one of the ARPA'S early leaders, he envisioned a
        web of inter-connected computers feeding information to each other. Many could
        be destroyed in a nuclear attack, and still the larger communications system
        would remain intact. The idea became a reality in 1969 when four universities
        involved in ARPA projects had their computers connected. By 1972, they were
        sending e-mail to each other. The Internet was born. For more on the military's
