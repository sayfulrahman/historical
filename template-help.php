            to start. I found my father's World War II enlistment information by typing in
            his last name in the search box on their web site.
            This database contains records of approximately nine million men and women who
            enlisted in the United States Army, including the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps.
            Although incomplete, the records contain data for a majority of the enlistments
            in the United States Army during World War II.</font>
