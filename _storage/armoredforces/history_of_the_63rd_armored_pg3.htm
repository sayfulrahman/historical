<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Indications pointed to an apparent planned and organized attempt by the
enemy to keep open a corridor into the BAVARIAN ALPS in the PASSAU – LINE
area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As well as endeavoring to
gain time in the Western portion of our zone by utilizing the ISAR and INN
RIVERS to organize hasty defensive positions to slow down our advance.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the last week of April there have been evidence of not only a definite
buildup in our zone of advance and on our eastern flank but indications of
greater control and organizational cohesion among the enemy units.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We had not seen this behavior in the enemy in some
time.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the basis of these developments and the enemy’s capabilities to
shift troops from CZECHOSLOVAKIA into the REDOUBT, it seemed likely that the
closer we approached this area the stronger and more organized will be the
resistance encountered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only
was the precipitous terrain likely to greatly favor an effective defense, but
the enemy concentrated in the area might prove to be the last hard core
fanatics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As had been repeatedly painted out for some time, the enemy had no
offensive power except perhaps on a small scale for local defensive purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was particularly true on our eastern flank where the enemy
apparently was endeavoring to keep open a corridor into the REDOUBT for his
forces retiring before the advancing Russians in CZECHOSLOVAKIA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If the enemy really planned fight it out to the last in the ALPS that
showdown was rapidly approaching and his capabilities for effective resistance
there were not to be underestimated. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>On
the other hand, it remained to be seen whether the enemy would attempt such a
finale.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial">The history making juncture this
past week of Russian and American forces north of DRESDEN (1<sup>st</sup> Army
area) in effect created two tremendous pockets for the German forces the
Northern one extending from DRESDEN through DENMARK to NORWAY, and from the
northwest tip of HOLLAND eastward to STETTIN.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pocketed in this area were an estimated total of some 50 or 60 nominal
enemy divisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In KURLAND and
EAST PRUSSIA (DANZIG area) an estimated 64 nominal enemy divisions were cut off
and possibly 11 more were making a fortress stand in the HAGUE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the South, the 3<sup>RD</sup> ARMY’s drive across the DANUBE and
into the PASSAU area, threatening imminent juncture with the Russian forces in
the DANUBE VALLEY, forecasted for the enemy a major split of his southern
forces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Present disposition
indicated that virtually all of the Army Group Center on the Eastern front and
the remnants of the 7<sup>TH</sup> GERMAN ARMY on the Western front, an
estimated 50 nominal divisions, might be trapped in the BOHEMIA – MORAVIA when
the narrowing gap between the 3<sup>rd</sup> US ARMY and the Russian forces was
closed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The troops being entrapped
in CZECHOSLOVAKIA even now could expect little in the way of reinforcements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, several Panzer-type divisions had moved south to escape
the pocket forming north of the DANUBE RIVER.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With the closing of the PASSAU – ST. POLLTEN gap the enemy would be
left with still another large pocket, consisting of that part of AUSTRIA not yet
overrun by the Allies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dispositions
at the present time indicated that approximately 50 nominal enemy divisions were
engaged just northwest of the AUSTRIAN border and in EAST AUSTRIA.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>These included most of Army Group South on the Eastern Front
and the remnants of the 19<sup>th</sup> and 1<sup>st</sup> German Armies on the
Western front.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In ITALY there were
a nominal 25 divisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The present
tactical situation on the ITALIAN front and the enemy’s tremendous logistical
problems involved in moving troops out of ITALY had made large-scale
reinforcements of other fronts with troops from ITALY virtually ineffective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Recent evidence indicated that the enemy had markedly increased his
efforts to evacuate YUGOSLAVIA, where Partisans had been waging a very
successful war of attrition – this evacuation was however a slow and hazardous
process.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial">Thus the enemy’s grand total
