Newman:</font></strong><font color="#408080"> <strong>( 1921 to 1945 )</strong> <strong>Born
in Southeast Missouri, in New Madrid County probably around Lilbourn or close to
a small town named Canalou</strong></font><strong>.</strong>&nbsp; <font color="#408080"><strong>He

Company &quot;B&quot; from 1942 to January 1945, He was KIA ( killed in action )
in the attack on Hattan-Rittershoffen, France, on or about January 13,

<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#408080">Gen. Hamilton Hawkins Howze:</font></strong><font color="#408080"><strong>
( Died -8 December 1998 ) Gen. Howze died at the age of 89, in Ft. Worth Texas,
a fourth generation decorated veteran. In the early 1960's Gen. Howze presided
over the Army's Tactical Mobility Requirement Board, later known as the Howze
Board. It explored the effectiveness of the air mobile operations. He was
instrumental in the Army reorganization of the First Cavalry Division which
fought in Vietnam between 1965 and 1971. His concept was one which &quot;air
vehicles, particularly air helicopters&quot; replaced ground vehicles.</strong></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#408080">&quot;Instead of aviation
aircraft performing supplementary functions, such as transportation or
observation or supplementing the firepower, the air vehicles became the primary
means of doing these things, particularly the helicopter gunship. Gen. Howze led
the introduction of helicopters &quot;carrying rockets and machine guns,
delivering firepower&quot; During the 1950's he was Commanding Officer of the
82nd Airborne Division and later of the 18th Airborne Corps. In 1955, he was
named director of Army Aviation in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for
Military Operations. He was later Chief of the U.S. Army Advisory Group in
Korea. Burial will be at West Point where he was born. </font></strong><font color="#408080"><strong>There
is more to the story, Gen. Howze also was active in WW 11 and was in the African
and Italian campaigns, more later about Gen. Howze in WW 11.</strong></font></font></p>

<p><strong><font color="#408080" face="Arial">Dear fellow Redhorser,</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#408080" face="Arial">Most of you will know that we have lost
last year or fellow Trooper and friend James D. Newton and with this message I
wanted to continue Jim’s November 29th letter and remind each of us
&quot;C&quot; Troops longest night at Beeck, Germany.</font></p>
<p><font color="#408080" face="Arial">During that long night of November 29/30
1944 about thousand enemy rounds of artillery landing on the positions of
&quot;C&quot; Troop 125th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron (Mecz.) near the
German village of Beeck, and it was for many men an miracle that only one fellow
&quot;C&quot; Trooper was killed by the enemy artillery fire at Beeck.</font></p>
<p><font color="#408080" face="Arial">World War Two ended in 1945 and the only
killed Trooper in that small German village with the name of Beeck, sergeant
William J. Longer lies now buried together with 8301 fellow Americans at the
Netherlands American Military Cemetery and Memorial near the Dutch village of
Margraten.</font></p>
<p><font color="#408080" face="Arial">William J. Longer from Washington, Iowa
was not a survivor of the fighting’s in and around Beeck and too remember him
and each of the 175 other fallen Troopers of the Red Horse Cavalry that did not
came back home alive again from the war in Europe, I wanted to ask you all to
join me in an toast on:</font></p>

<p><font color="#408080" face="Arial">Let us with our toast further remember all
the deceased Red Horse veterans on the way they would enjoy it and continue the
toast that some of them have started many years ago and of which it was for me
personally a privilege and an honor to toast with each year on November 29th.</font></p>
<p><font color="#408080" face="Arial">Health, Bon Sante, Prosit, Cheers, Skoal,
Salut, Mazaltov, Proost and Gezondheid for your toast on November 29th from your
