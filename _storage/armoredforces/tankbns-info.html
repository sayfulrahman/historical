October 1941, the 34th Regiment was activated at Fort Knox, Kentucky and began
training. From October 1941 to July 1943 the unit trained at Fort Knox,
Kentucky, Camp Cooke, California and the Tennessee Maneuver Area. In July of
1943 the 34th Regiment moved to Pine Camp, New York to continue training.<o:p>

 <i>BRIEF HISTORY OF THE 113TH CAVALRY GROUP (MECZ.)</i></font></p>
<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">FROM NORMANDY TO THE LINK-UP
WITH THE RUSSIANS</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The 113th Cavalry Group, known from its coat of
arms as the Red Horse Cavalry, was launched into action against the Germans for
the second time in its history on July 4, 1944 in the St Jean de Daye area. From
that time until the German surrender Der Führer's soldiers felt both the
lightening thrusts and the steady pressure of this distinguished unit. The
Group, which comprises Headquarters and Headquarters Troop 113th Cavalry Group,
Mechanized, 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized, and 125th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized, ( see memorial on TAPS page )started its
military career as Iowa National Guard Cavalry in July 1915, and during World
War I it saw action as a machine-gun unit. Called into Federal Service again on
January 13, 1941 with one Squadron &quot;mechanized&quot; and the other
&quot;horsed&quot;, the Regiment became fully mechanized in April 1942.
Preparation and training for World War I I carried the Regiment to Camp Bowie,
the Mexican Border, and Camp Hood, Texas; and to Camp Livingston and Camp Polk,
Louisiana, as well as to three large-scale Louisiana Maneuvers. In August 1943
the 113th Cavalry became Corps Reconnaissance Regiment for the III Armored
Corps, later XIX Corps, an association renewed in England in early 1944 and
maintained with few interruptions thereafter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On February 6, 1944, the 113th Cavalry Regiment
was reorganized into a Group Headquarters and two Squadrons, the 113th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron, Mechanized, and the 125th Cavalry Reconnaissance
Squadron, Mechanized. Col. William S. Biddle, of Portland, Oregon, and U.S.
Military Academy Class Of 1923, who had commanded the Regiment, became the Group
Commander; and Lt. Col. Allen D. Hulse of San Antonio, Texas, and U. S. Military
Academy Class of 1938, who had commanded the 1st Squadron of the Regiment,
assumed command of the 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron. The 125th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron was commanded by Lt. Col. Jeff F. Hollis, of Tampa,
Florida, who had commanded the 2nd Squadron of the Regiment. Lt. Col. Anthony F.
Kleitz, of Denver, Colorado, and U. S. Military Academy Class Of 1933, took
command of the 125th Squadron in August 1944, at which time Lt. Col. Hollis
assumed the duties of Group Executive Officer. Primarily intended and trained
for long-distance mounted reconnaissance, the Red Horse Cavalry saw all kinds of
action in Normandy, Northern France, Belgium, Holland, and Germany, usually in
the forefront of the battle. In its first engagement, in Normandy, the Red Horse
Cavalry put aside its mechanized reconnaissance tactics and cut its teeth on one
of Hitler's best SS Panzer Grenadier Divisions, the 17th, when the Group crossed
the Vire et Taute Canal on July 7th and took the towns of Goucherie and Le
Mesnil-Veneron. For four days, it fought in the treacherous hedgerows against
what turned out to be the spearhead of a German counterattack aimed at Carentan
and Isigny, and won the commendation of Maj. Gen. Charles H. Corlett, XIX Corps
Commander. Following a Task Force of the 29th Infantry Division into St Lo on
July 18th, the 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron attempted mounted
reconnaissance to the high ground south of that city; but German paratroopers
were found to be too deeply entrenched in the hedgerows, and so the Group,
working under the 35th Infantry Division, again went into dismounted action. A
rugged week, with intense artillery, mortar, and small arms fire, followed,
during which both Squadrons took turns patrolling well into enemy lines.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On July 28th, by-passing St Lo, the Red Horsemen
moved towards Percy to join Brig. Gen. Maurice Rose and his 2d Armored Division
Combat Command &quot;A&quot;. Here the Group forward Command Post and Troop
,B&quot; 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron were cut off with part of Combat
Command &quot;A&quot; at Villebaudon for two days when Hitler's 116th Panzer
Division counterattacked towards Le Mesnil Herman. Severe fighting, and heavy
artillery and mortar fire, were encountered here, but presently the enemy effort
was spent. and it became possible slowly to resume progress to the south. From
July 3oth to August 4th, the Group operated under 28th Infantry Division,
maintaining flank contact with other units from the vicinity of Percy to
Margueray. During part of this general period, the 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance
Squadron performed a true but difficult mechanized cavalry reconnaissance
mission, moving with the 2d Armored Division in their advance west of Vire, over
roads where mines and booby-traps were plentiful. This mission completed, the
Group, reunited, joined in the advance on Gathemo. After Gathemo had fallen, the
Red Horse got his first opportunity to stretch his legs. On August 13th, in a
fast move of the type which made it famous, the Group marched 32 miles to
Mortain, paused, and then established a moving screen in front of the crack 3oth
Infantry Division to Dornfront. Here the 125th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron
cooperated with the 82d Armored Reconnaissance Battalion in the capture of that
heavily defended 17th Century Fortress, participating in the heavy fighting on
the flanks of the Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, while the 113th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron fought hard and well in covering a sizeable gap between
two advancing infantry regiments. For this screening operation, the Group was
commended by the Division Commander, Maj. Gen. Leland S. Hobbs. Before daybreak
on the morning of August 19th, the Group again jumped off with the mission of
preceding the 3oth Infantry Division, this time to the Brezolles area, there to
cover the de-trucking of that division, which was leading the XIX Corps in its
fast flanking move to cut off the retreating Germans who were streaming out of
the Falaise Gap. Late the same day, the two Squadrons had not only completed
this march of some 106 miles but had established contact with very strong enemy
forces on the river Avre southeast of Verneuil, and had set up a series of road
blocks to insure the unhampered de-trucking of the division. During the night of
August 20th, the Group &quot;spread out&quot; to the west from Verneuil to Sees
to fill a 35 mile &quot;gap&quot; between XIX Corps and V Corps. This, zone was
greatly narrowed the next day by the arrival of an infantry division and another
Cavalry Group; and so the Red Horse units closed in towards Verneuil and then
commenced a 36 mile advance to the north, protecting the Tomahawk Corps' left
flank. In the execution of this mission the Group reconnoitered and cleared out
the area between the Verneuil-Le Neubourg road and the Risle River, including
the great Forets de Breteuil and de Conches, and established first contact with
powerful British forces which had just closed the Falaise-Argentan Gap and were
advancing from the west. During a 3-day period of this operation, the Group
captured 1000 prisoners of war and inflicted an estimated 400 enemy casualties;
and during five days, it cleared an area of more than 430 square miles. In its
next operation, the Group crossed the Seine River on the outskirts of Paris at
St Germain-en-Laye early August 28th, and in 4 days routed a desperate enemy
from over a 175-square-mile triangular area northeast of the Seine and southwest
of the River Oise. Here the Red Horse Cavalry, reinforced by Company
&quot;B&quot; 82d Engineer (Combat) Battalion and Company &quot;B&quot; 803d
Tank Destroyer Battalion, fought &quot;on its own&quot;, without support and
separated from the remainder of the Corps by the unaffordable Oise, over which
all bridges had been destroyed. In this area, which had once been a German
industrial center, one sea-plane assembly plant, several underground Luftwaffe
repair shops and depots, and 9 V-1 launching sites were overrun. It was here,
too, that the gratitude of the French people became so evident; and their
willing assistance to drive &quot;Le Boche&quot; frorn France counted for much.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On September 1st, the Group, still reinforced,
crossed the Oise River at Beaumont-Sur-Oise and led the infantry divisions of
XIX Corps - the 30th and the 79th - on a 2-day dash through northern France
across the Belgian border to Tournai, a distance of over 150 miles against enemy
opposition. The first night was spent on the River Somme, over which the
retreating Germans had destroyed all bridges; and, although patrols crossed
promptly, it was necessary for engineers to construct a bridge before main
forces could continue the advance. This was done early the next morning; and,
after sharp engagements by both Squadrons in the vicinity of Cambrai, the
Belgian border was crossed on the afternoon of September 2d, Red Horse units
being among the first Allied troops to enter Belgium. On September 5th, the
Group, again under the Tomahawk Corps, and with Company, &quot;B&quot; 82d
Engineer (Combat) Battalion and Company &quot;C&quot; 803d Tank Destroyer
Battalion attached, moved out on what is believed to have been one of the most
spectacular mechanized cavalry reconnaissance missions in military history, when
it made its brilliant dash across Belgium 3 days in advance of the Corps. Light
and moderate resistance, which was encountered everywhere, was fought and
eliminated or brushed aside, and heavy resistance, of which there was
considerable, was reported and by-passed. All types of enemy, from Panther tanks
to infantry, were encountered. Messenger service was maintained by plane and
communications by long-distance radio. A more perfect Cavalry mission could
hardly have been imagined. Many towns were &quot;liberated&quot; and the joy of
the Belgians knew no bounds. Armored cars and jeeps were festooned with flowers
and laden with delicious fruits. Champagne and fine wines flowed freely - dug up
from the yards and gardens after 4 years when &quot;les Americains&quot;
appeared. On the afternoon of September 8th, the objective - the Albert Canal -
was reached, after an advance of 128 Miles across Belgium; and the Group set up
a screen along the Canal. Famous Fort Eben Emael,. which was found to be
occupied by a battalion of enemy, was reconnoitered by patrols. On the morning
of September 11th, the Group, having been relieved by 30th Infantry Division,
which had made a forced march to reach the Canal, made a sweeping 35 mile
&quot;end run&quot; to the south to cross the Meuse River at Liege and then move
north along the east bank of the river against stiff opposition, pushing the
enemy to the north and securing a bridgehead south of Visé which made possible
the construction of a bridge and the crossing of the river by the 30th Infantry
Division. Then, attached to 30th Infantry Division, and with the 125th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron on the right flank and the 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance
Squadron on the left flank, the Group continued to move north and northeast,
assisting the division in the liberation of Maastricht and sharing the honor of
being the first American Troops in Holland. Not long after, troops of the I25th
Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron entered Germany, among the first elements of XIX
Corps to cross that frontier. Soon after, the powerful 2d Armored Division
crossed the Meuse and seized the area north of Maastricht. On September 19th,
the Group (less 125th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron which, for some 2 weeks,
remained with 30th Infantry Division, effectively protecting that division's
right flank generally northwest of Aachen) relieved elements of 2d Armored
Division on the line from the Maas River to the German Border, generally north
of Sittard, Holland. The 744th Tank Battalion (Light) and 246th Engineer
(Combat) Battalion joined the 113th. Cavalry Group at this time, the former
remaining attached for some 3 months. On September 22d, the Group sector was
extended eastward to include Gangelt, Germany, giving the Group a front of over
10 miles, which was held until November 13th under the successive control of XIX
Corps, 29th Infantry Division, XIII Corps and Guards Armored Division (British).
In late September, the 125th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron rejoined the Group
and the 246th Engineer (Combat) Battalion was relieved from attachment. Company,
&quot;C&quot; 234th Engineer (Combat) Battalion and Company, &quot;C&quot; 821st
Tank Destroyer Battalion then took over the support of the Group, and a number
of field artillery battalions became closely associated with the Cavalry,
including the 92d Armored, the 111th and the 283d. Furthermore, the 17th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron, of the 15th Cavalry Group, was attached to the 113th
Cavalry Group during its final two weeks in the sector. This long period was not
entirely a defensive one, however, as soon after taking over the sector from 2d
Armored Division, the Group, reinforced also by Company &quot;G&quot; 66th
Armored Regiment, launched an attack which rolled its left flank along the Maas
River northwards a distance of some 3 miles. In early October, a gallant effort
was made to advance the Group line further to the north, but the enemy strength
was such that this line remained largely fixed until mid-January when powerful
British forces launched their successful attack. Although the Group's mission
thus became defensive, continuous and aggressive cavalry patrols harassed the
enemy and gained a wealth of information. The Red Horse Cavalrymen, with 744th
Tank Battalion (Light) still attached, next moved to the Geilenkirchen area,
taking over, in late November and under 84th Infantry Division, a sector within
the Siegfried Line, vigorously defended by German Infantry supported by tanks
and much artillery. The town of Beeck was captured November 29-30th by 125th
Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, strongly reinforced by 1st Battalion 333d
Infantry Regiment. For 2 days, that Squadron was subjected to intense artillery
shelling in this area, receiving, during one period of 6 or 7 hours, some 1000
rounds of various caliber's. In conjunction with the German counter offensive
against the First U.S. Army, launched early December 16, 1944, enemy
paratroopers were dropped in Ninth Army rear areas during the night December
16-17, to disrupt communications, destroy supplies, and seize installations.
Accordingly, on December, 17, the 125th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, then in
113th Cavalry Group Reserve south of Geilenkirchen, was given the mission, in
the general area Maastricht-Aachen-Liege and under Ninth Army control, of
patrolling, setting up road blocks, and being prepared to move, rapidly to meet
air-borne threats in the area. The remainder of the Group remained on its
defensive mission in the Geilenkirchen area until shortly after Christmas, when,
as the XIX Corps moved south to the vicinity of Aachen to take over the
divisions formerly under VII Corps, the Group, which had become attached to the
102d Infantry Division on December 20, was relieved of its sector in the
Geilenkirchen area. Moving to the area of Gey at the northern edge of the
Hurtgen Forest, the Group, less 125th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron and 744th
Light Tank Battalion but reinforced by 295th Engineer Combat Battalion and
supported by 25th Field Artillery Battalion and Company &quot;C&quot;, 817th
Tank Destroyer Battalion, relieved. during the night December 25-26, the 330th
Infantry Regiment of the 83d Infantry Division, which had just completed the
clearing of the west bank of the Roer River in the vicinity of Winden and
Untermaubach. During the defense of this difficult sector of the north shoulder
of the &quot;Bulge&quot;, the Group patrolled aggressively, and during the night
January 19-20, Troop &quot;C&quot;, 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron
conducted a raid across the Roer, returning with 6 Prisoners of War, the first
taken on the Corps front for over three weeks. Furthermore, 234th and 82nd
Engineer Combat Battalions successively joined the Group, under a rotation
scheme for Engineer Battalions directed by the Commanding Officer, 1115th
Engineer Group; and on January, 28, 1945, 125th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron
relieved 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron in the defensive sector and was
in turn relieved by the latter Squadron on its rear area security mission under
Ninth Army. Early in February, when XIX Corps regrouped for offensive action, in
preparation for &quot;Operation Grenade&quot;, the crossing of the Roer and the
advance to the Rhine, the Group, less I13th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron but
again reinforced by the 744th Light Tank Battalion, moved north; on 6 February
1945, relieved elements of the 29th Infantry Division along the west bank of the
Roer River in the vicinity of Inden, a sector which was held, initially under
29th Infantry Division but principally under 30th Infantry Division, until
February 24. A very grave threat to the forthcoming operation was the
possibility of the flooding of the Roer River Valley by the enemy, should he
blow the Urft and Schwarnmanual Dams; and on 9 February, the Roer River began to
rise, following the opening of the flood-gates by the enemy. The flood continued
until the night of February 13-14, when a drop was first noticed. On the night
of February 22-23, the speed of the current had diminished to a point where the
river could be bridged; and following an intensive artillery preparation fired
by over 500 guns, the 30th Infantry. Division, crossing a difficult stretch of
river and swamp, moved rapidly to the other side, and had their bridgehead well
in hand by the end of the first day. All elements of the Group remained in their
defensive positions until the success of the Division attack was assured, after
which they passed into Division Reserve.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On February 26, the Group, less 113th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron and 744th Light Tank Battalion, moved across the river
and, reinforced by the 801st Tank Destroyer Battalion, successively covered
portions of the Division's (and Corps') right flank and rear between the Hambach
Forest and the Erft River, until progress by VII Corps units on the right
relieved the Group of its mission. The direction of the Corps attack, in
wheeling to the northeast instead of crossing the Erft River and attacking
Cologne, had thrown the enemy off balance, and the speed of the advance did not
give them breathing space to stop and organize. The resistance encountered by
the Group varied from scattered elements of Infantry and Panzer Divisions, which
had been chopped up by the swift advance of the 2d Armored, 29th and 30th
Infantry Divisions, to stubborn resistance met by 125th Cavalry Reconnaissance
Squadron on February 28 from dug-in infantry and from mortars and self-propelled
guns, at Bedburg, guarding the crossing, of the Erft River. On February 28, the
113th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron rejoined the Group. With the seizure of
the west bank of the Rhine River from Neuss to Uerdingen, the Corps was ready
and anxious to force the crossing forthwith, and plans were made for the Group,
which on March 1 had passed into Corps Reserve, to exploit a breakthrough after
the initial crossing. However, higher headquarters decided to delay the crossing
until a coordinated drive could be launched which could be sustained until final
victory, and so extensive preparations for the crossing were initiated by
assault troops. On March 10, the Group, still reinforced by the 801st Tank
Destroyer Battalion and now supported by the 2d Armored Division Artillery,
moved to the Rhine under XIX Corps control and occupied, until March 29, a 15
mile defensive sector on the west bank of the Rhine River from Dormagen to the
Erft River, relieving the 4th Cavalry Group, reinforced, of VII Corps. In the
great amphibious operation of crossing the Rhine, the XIX Corps was selected to
spearhead the Ninth U. S. Army drive, once the bridgehead had been established.
The latter operation began on the night of March 23, under XVI Corps; and by
March 29, the 2d Armored Division, leading the XIX Corps advance, had crossed
the Rhine and was attacking east, north of the Lippe River. The 113th Cavalry
Group, with the 801st Tank Destroyer Battalion still attached, crossed the Rhine
on March 30. Early on April 1, it commenced execution of the mission of
protecting the north flank of the Corps, maintaining contact between the forward
elements of XIX Corps (2 Armored Division) and XIII Corps (5th Armored
Division), and initially of screening the assembly of the 30th and 95th Infantry
Divisions. This proved to be a difficult mission, for upon reaching the
Dortmund-Ems Canal, the 2d Armored Division, finding the bridges blown, built
its own bridge, and rolled on east to establish contact near Paderborn with
troops of VII Corps advancing from the southwest and thus seal off the Ruhr.
Accordingly, forward elements of the XIII Corps were not able to maintain the
pace of the 2d Armored Division; and so at one time the Group, which became
attached to 30th Infantry Division on April 2, was disposed over a front of 35
miles. After the sealing off of the Ruhr, it was decided that the 2d Armored
Division, followed in trace by the 30th Infantry Division, and with the 83d
Infantry Division, reinforced, operating abreast and on the right, would attack
east, - while the other divisions of the Corps were helping to reduce the Ruhr
pocket.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On April 3, therefore, the Group, less 125th
Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron and 801st Tank Destroyer Battalion (which were
to remain with 30th Infantry Division until the Corps north flank should become
more secure), became attached to 83d Infantry Division; and on April 4th,
reinforced principally by 2d Battalion 331st Infantry, motorized, 25th Field
Artillery Battalion, and by 736th Tank Battalion (less Medium Tank Companies),
and later (April 5th) rejoined by 125th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, the
113th Cavalry Group operated in advance of the 83d Infantry Division on its
drive to the Weser River, eliminating light and moderate resistance and
containing and by-passing heavy resistance to be dealt with by infantry elements
which followed. On the first day of this operation, the Group came up against
the Teutoburger Forest on a long, high ridge running generally north and south
across the Corps sector, and, after hard fighting, broke through that obstacle.
When the Weser River was reached, on April 6th, the bridges were found blown,
although often the destruction had been accomplished at the last moment.
Crossing the Weser River on April 7th, over a bridge constructed in the southern
part of the 2d Armored Division zone, the Group, with 2d Battalion 331st
Infantry, motorized, and 25th Field Artillery Battalion still attached, moved
southeast across the Division front and then screened the advance of the right
Regimental Combat Team of the 83d Infantry Division and protected the Corps
right flank to the Leine River, where bridges were seized across the river. In
the course of this operation, on April 9th, the 125th Reconnaissance Squadron
became attached to the 30th Infantry Division, which had been given a zone of
action on the northern flank of the 2d Armored Division. The Squadron,
reinforced principally by Company &quot;C&quot; 801st Tank Destroyer Battalion,
30th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop and 1 Platoon 743d Tank Battalion, operated in
a zone on the left flank of 30th Infantry Division, protecting the left flank of
that Division and maintaining contact with elements of XIII Corps. On April
11th, personnel the Squadron played prominent roles in negotiations, never
consummated, for the surrender of Braunschweig. On April 13th, the Squadron
reached the Elbe River and defended its western bank. Also on April 9th, the
Group accepted the surrender of the city of Einbeck, captured by Troop
&quot;B&quot; 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, and a considerable number
of German officers, including two General Officers and five Colonels. During the
night April 9-10, 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron defended city against a
threat from a large column of enemy tanks and horse-drawn vehicles which were
approaching from the southwest in an attempt to escape east.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On April 11th, the Group (less 125th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron, Troop &quot;A&quot; 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance
Squadron which passed into Corps Reserve, and Troop &quot;C&quot; 113th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron which was attached to 330th Infantry Regiment), with 3d
Battalion 331st Infantry, motorized, and 25th Field Artillery Battalion
attached, moved rapidly along the northern edge of the Harz Mountains,
successively capturing Ilsenburg, Altenburg and Wernigerode, where stiff
resistance was encountered after entering the town. Moving east, it fought
gallantly on April 12th and 13th in an effort to reduce the fortified town of
Heimburg, strongly held by dug-in infantry on high ground dominating the
approaches to the town. Establishing road blocks along the northern edge of the
mountains, the Group, rejoined by Troop &quot;C&quot; 113th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron late on April 12, aided in sealing off the large pocket
of German troops who had sought refuge in the Harz Mountains, center of much
tradition of the ancient German gods. Early on April 14th, elements of the 8th
Armored Division relieved the Group of its road blocks in the Harz Mountain
area; and the Group, less 3d Battalion 331st Infantry and 25th Field Artillery
Battalion, then moved to the east and defended the exposed southern flank of the
Division (and Corps) as far east as the Saale River. Commencing April 17th, the
113th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron, under Group control and reinforced by 83d
Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop, assisted in the cleaning out of' the pocket
between the Saale and Elbe Rivers; and on April 19th, the Squadron moved up and
took over the defense of the west bank of the Elbe River, in the Division
sector, south of the bridgehead which had been established by the 83d Infantry
Division opposite Barby and Breitenhagen. On April 23d, the Group, rejoined by
Troop &quot;A&quot; 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron on April 21st and by
125th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron on April 23d, also took over the defense
of the Elbe River north of the bridgehead, and assumed responsibility for the
security of the entire Division area west of the Elbe and helped institute
Military Government in that area. On April 30th, 113th Cavalry Reconnaissance
Squadron took complete administrative charge of a considerable sector west of
the Saale River and set up facilities for receiving and feeding thousands of
displaced persons who were being brought from the west. Following the capture of
Zerbst by the 329th Infantry Regiment on April 28th, the 125th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron, which had, on April 23d, relieved the 113th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron of the defense of the Elbe River line, fought east and
southeast under Group control, against resistance, and, after a brilliant 2-day
operation which placed the Squadron some 25 miles beyond other elements of the
Corps, made contact with the 1st Battalion 320th Infantry Regiment of the 121st
Russian Elite Infantry Division, at Apollensdorf, on 30 April 1945, the first
contact between the Ninth U.S. Army and Russian forces and the second contact
between American and Russian forces in the European Theater of Operations. For
its combat performance under 83d Infantry Division from 3 to 30 April 1945, the
Group received the written commendation of Maj. Gen. Robert C. Macon, Division
Commander. May 1st therefore found 113th Cavalry Group performing two entirely
separate and widely divergent missions - one of Area Security and Military
Government in a considerable area west of the Saale River; and another of
maintaining contact with the Russian forces well east of the Elbe River. Later,
the Russians moved west to the Elbe, and on 5 May, therefore, the 125th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron was withdrawn west of the river and took up the mission
of security and Military Government in a portion of the Group sector.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">On 5 May the Group became attached to 30th
Division Artillery and its sector of responsibility was extended east to the
Elbe. On 7 May, the Group was relieve preparatory to rejoining XIX Corps in its
new occupational area, near Bad Nauheim, north of Frankfurt. During 312 days of
combat and over a distance of some 800 miles from the Normandy Bridgehead to
east of the Elbe, the Group destroyed or captured approximately 600 enemy tanks,
armored cars, half-tracks and vehicles, captured 21.599 prisoners, and overran
many factories, supply depots, airfields and installations. Furthermore, it won
3 written commendations from Commanding, Generals of Corps and Divisions under
whom it had served, and decorations won by individual members of the command
included, as of 9 July 1945, 2 Distinguished Service Crosses, 1 Legion of Merit,
96 Silver Stars, 454 Bronze Stars, 870 Purple Hearts, 1 Legion d'Honneur
(French), 7 Croix de Guerre (French), 1 Military Cross (British) and 1 Military
Medal (British). This, then, completes the Saga of a Cavalry Group which,
through its gallantry, its skill and its high esprit, gained for itself an
enviable reputation as a hard fighting and versatile combat unit.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><i>a short story of the 743rd
Tank Battalion in the vicinity of South -Limburg.</i></font></p>
<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">conducted by Reconman</font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial">The 743rd Tank Battalion was one off the first
American Armored units to have tanks in Belgium, tanks of the 743rd Tank
Battalion (attached to the 30th Infantry Division) were also together with the
light M5 tanks of the 113th Cavalry Group the first American tanks in Holland.
The 1st platoon of Charlie Company of the 743rd Tank Battalion crossed the
international boundary into the Netherlands and the village of Mheer at 5 o
clock in the afternoon, September 12th 1944. And now the &quot;rat racing&quot;
was over. When the platoon column began to move out of the little Dutch village
called Mheer, the lead tank was fired on by a enemy pantzerfaust gunner. The
rocket missed its target. Infantrymen of the 30th Infantry Division took quick
care of the German pantzerfaust gunner. The dough-boys then kept right on
hoofing it to the next town. The tanks of the 743rd stopped. They were again out
of gas. The reality of war was grimly present once more. Along the Maas River,
the Germans showed a frantic - and frantic - determination to throw up some
semblance of a line from Maastricht to Charleville after vacating Charleroi,
Mons, and Tournai. The Maas thus was the German Army's first defense line to
confront the First American Army after the Seine crossing. There were remnants
of four infantry and seven German panzer divisions dug in there. By September
12, the First Army's sustained drive had been stopped. The war settled down to a
foot-soldier's walk again. Ahead was some of the bitterest fighting of the war.
The sprawling, ancient city of Maastricht threw away its Nazi swastikas and
unfurled its red, white and bleu flag of the Netherlands on September 14, 1944.
Able Company worked with the 117th Infantry to clear Maastricht. At the same
time, Charlie Company went eastward into Oud Valkenburg which was supposed to
contain friendly troops. Instead the place was occupied by German infantry. When
enemy artillery began to range in, the tanks set up a defense in nearby
Valkenburg. The 743rd Tank Battalion was counting casualties again by enemy
artillery fire. As the 30th Infantry Division together with the 125th Cavalry
Reconnaissance Squadron pushed along the Maastricht - Aachen road, the Germans
threw in heavy concentrations of shellfire. This artillery was to be steady diet
for months to come. Across the 20 mile stretch of Holland that comprises the
Panhandle thrust down between Belgiun and Germany, the three key towns in the
route of the 30th Infantry Division were Maastricht, Valkenburg, and Heerlen.
Maastricht was cleared. Valkenburg was next. Then on September 17th Charlie
Company helped to liberate the neat-as-a-pin town of Heerlen. Other units were
entering the town north, south, east and west, such as Ubachsberg, Kunrade,
Welten, Terwinselen. On September 19th the 743rd Tank Battalion had some of its
tanks (1 company) inside Germany. Earlier the mortar and assault gun platoons
had fired on targets inside Germany. On September 19th, Able Company crossed the
Dutch-German border and advanced into Scherpenseel, supporting the 1st Battalion
of the 117th Infantry Regiment. Plans were readied for an attack through the
Siegfried Line beyond Scherpenseel, but bad weather settled down, grounding the
air support, and the attack was put off 24 hours - and then indefinitely. As the
First Army marked time before the pill boxes and dragon's teeth, an all-out
attack was being planned to crack open the line. From September 20th to October
2nd , the companies and all units readied themselves for the assault. The 30th
Infantry Division had a sector 10 miles north of the German city of Aachen. The
swift and ugly ribbon of water called the Würm River ran through the sector
before the Todt-built fortifications. And a few thousand yards front of these
bristling defenses as enemy artillery probed about seeking to destroy troop
concentrations, tanks and infantry again, as they did before the hedgerows,
rehearsed special maneuvers. This time the problem was not to crush natural
barries, but man-made structures: mushroom-thick, cunningly placed pill boxes,
tank traps, barbed wire entanglements and field fortifications of every
description. As the days went by to October 2nd, officers and men studied their
maps, briefed themselves on every detail of the terrain and known defenses
ahead. They studied aerial photos and made plans for the approach and breaching
of each identified obstacle. And trucks took man back to Heerlen for hot showers
and the two U.S.O. stage shows. Then the push to crack the Siegfried Line began.
While the big pursuit from France to Belgium trying to head the retreating
Germans off before they could scurry behind their Siegfried defenses was a vast
operation on a canvas so broad that the individual soldier was almost lost to
sight in the great mass movement, the individual was there. He was there hunched
on the hard seat in the back of an overcrowded half-track, or cramped into the
bucket chair inside a tank, or feeling each bounce in the road in the
rough-riding peep. The individual was there, every man with his own adventure
and his own story to tell (or not to tell) in his own way. Behind him was the
Normandy campaign, the Battle of Northern France, the drive through Belgium and
Holland. Ahead was the Battle of Germany. The generals had it mapped out. But
the individual would fight it. More to come.</font></i>
