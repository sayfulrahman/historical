<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><u>Conclusion at
this Time</u></b>:</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Doubtless being more or less well informed as to our strength and
dispositions and demonstrating the German psychology of never surrendering
ground without fighting for it, coupled with the valuable road net centering in
BASTOGNE, the enemy would no doubt counter-attack with a view to re-isolating
the BASTOGNE POCKET and even hoping to capture it.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The build-up in the HOTTON area, where elements of the enemy’s 2<sup>nd</sup>
PANZER and 116<sup>th</sup> PANZER DIVISIONS with the 560<sup>th</sup> VOLKS-GRENADIER
DIVISION had been located, pointed to a continuation of his drive to the West.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The objective of the Germans, which had been repeatedly stated by POWs
from all fronts, was the city of ANTWERP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
had still not committed these as well as other Panzer Divisions and various
Infantry Divisions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Taking his many
statements of this offensive being an all-out gamble, there was every reason to
expect new divisions to show on this front.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><u><o:p>
</o:p>
</u></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The four field days enjoyed by our air support (Dec 23-26) had retarded
and thwarted his previous plans that would be put into effect at the earliest
possible moment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He had, according
to the Third Army, sufficient transport planes to mount parts of two Paratroop
Divisions, and should air conditions permit, they would very likely appear on
the scene.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up until this time he had shown little interest in the line south of ST.
HUBERT-GIVET.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This capability was
placed in a low category.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Until forced by overwhelming air superiority, formidable ground forces,
depletion of reserves, lack of supplies, and physical exhaustion to abandon his
offensive, there was no indication of him attempting to go on the defensive.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the 27<sup>th</sup> and 28<sup>th</sup> of December no regular enemy
front line existed on the VIII Corps front (Third Army Zone) but light contact
was reported at isolated outposts, defended road-blocks and patrols.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No aggressive tendencies by the enemy were displayed however.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The bulk of the activity was reported in the ST. HUBERT area, where the
enemy appeared to be concerned with the protection of his southern flank.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Enemy tank and SP guns continued to support attacks on the BASTOGNE
garrison and the 4<sup>TH</sup> ARMORED DIVISION CORRIDOR.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>No use of artillery was reported although considerable was available
according to air photo interpretation.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The weather was cloudy and cold with breaks in the clouds in the
afternoon.</font></p>

</span>On the 29<sup>th</sup> of December the Battalion received orders from CCA
to move with CCA to CHARLEVILLE by 0500, then to be prepared to march into an
unannounced concentration area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus
the Battalion crossed into BELGIUM and moved into an assembly area two miles
north of TRONQUOY at 1400 where maintenance was performed and preparations made
for combat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Here TASK FORCE WHITE
was formed comprising the following; the 63<sup>rd</sup> ARMORED INFANTRY
BATTALION (Minus Company “A”); 1 platoon of Company “B” of the 602<sup>nd</sup>
Tank Destroyer Battalion; 1 platoon of Company “A” of the 56<sup>th</sup>
Armored Engineer Battalion; and 1 platoon of Battery “C” of the 575<sup>th</sup>
Armored Anti-Aircraft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Company “A”
of the 63<sup>rd</sup> AIB was assigned to TASK FORCE BLUE.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First contact with the enemy was made by other units of CCA at 0820.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The enemy was holding a pocket south of REMAGNE and a line northwest of
LAVASELLE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Reconnaissance reported
REMAGNE encircled with automatic weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
enemy exhibited a defensive attitude generally, and maintained strong pockets
around REMAGNE and CHENOGNE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
succeeded in driving our forces out of CHENOGNE, and no indication pointed to
his withdrawing until forced to do so.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Estimated enemy casualties included 50 killed and 94 prisoners.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From an enemy broadcast it was apparent that his division had been
identified on its front.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Weather continued cloudy and cold, with ground conditions frozen and air
activity at a standstill.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Several reports indicated that the Germans were having supply
difficulties.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In view of the limited contact with the enemy on several sectors it was
believed that the enemy would await further developments to ascertain our main
effort before bringing in reinforcements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Orders came from CCA at 0500 on the 30<sup>th</sup> of December for TASK
FORCE WHITE to attack northeast at NIMBERMONT, BELGIUM in order to secure the
OURTHE RIVER LINE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>TASK FORCE WHITE
moved into the NIMBERMONT AREA at 0730 but came under intense heavy enemy
artillery, mortar, and anti-tank fire, suffered heavy casualties and being
unable to move forward were forced to withdraw.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus at 2300 they withdrew three miles south of RONDU and reorganized.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><o:p>

</span>At 0900 on the 31<sup>st</sup> of December TASK FORCE WHITE moved to an
assembly area four miles southeast of SIBRET to prepare for attack at 1430.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Companies “B” and “C” of the 63<sup>rd</sup> plus the attached
tank companies moved from the assembly area to secure and hold LAVASELLE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was done against slight resistance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>December 30<sup>th</sup> 1944 - The enemy had taken full advantage of the
terrain and had supplemented this with road locks prepared bridges and mine
fields.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He had supported his
mine fields with fire from expertly camouflaged positions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had held tenaciously to his position during the day, generally
exhibiting a defensive attitude, and employing engineers in more that normal
strength in this defensive role.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From the comparative ease, with which localities previously strongly
defended were later taken; from the appearance along the front of increasing
numbers of engineer troops, including a General Headquarters unit; from the
reports that the Germans had evacuated previously held localities west and
northwest of ST. HUBERT; and lastly because all his efforts to reduce the
BASTOGNE pocket had been costly failures it was believed that the Germans had
begun to fear the possibility of entrapment of his forces within that part of
the salient west and south of the river in an attempt to save as many of his
troops and tanks as possible from destruction.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>December 31<sup>st</sup> - The enemy had employed the following weaponry:
numerous dug in 88 MM guns as flat trajectory and artillery pieces; extensive
time fire artillery and mortar fire; they utilized mines especially on the
shoulders of roads and the fringes of woods; they infiltrated our lines during
the hours of dusk to harass and accomplish sniper missions; and they defended
key points with machine gun and rifle fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The enemy had fought stubbornly and had launched counter-attacks after
having been forced to give ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although
he fought defensively, it was with determination, and every effort was made to
inflict maximum damage before yielding ground.</font></p>

</span>On the 4<sup>th</sup> of January the enemy initially maintained an

the arrival of the 9<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> SS Panzer Divisions from
the 6<sup>th</sup> Panzer Army.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The

Division being reported west of HOUFFALIZE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Initial tank and infantry aggressiveness dwindled off during the

all along the line from SIBRET to BASTOGNE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>From the 6<sup>th</sup> to the 8<sup>th</sup> of January contact with the
enemy grew less and less and on the 8<sup>th</sup> there was no contact
whatsoever with the enemy by the Division.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The same situation held for the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> of
January.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There was still no contact
by the Division, but on the corps front a withdrawal of enemy forces in the 87<sup>th</sup>
Infantry Division sector seemed to presage a movement of all forces west of the
BASTOGNE BULGE to the east and escape from the threatened pincers of the 1<sup>st</sup>
and 3<sup>rd</sup> Armies.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the 12<sup>th</sup> of January there were definite indications that
the enemy was withdrawing his forces from the western end of the salient.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 87<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division was having difficulty maintaining
contact, and it progress was impeded by numerous mines, booby traps, and
roadblocks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the 17 Airborne
Division front, the enemy was holding a series of strongpoints on the LAVAL,
HUBERMONT, RENUAMONT and FLAMIERGE areas and the roads east of FLAMISOUL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>FLAMISOUL itself was occupied by friendly troops.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The enemy on the 101<sup>st</sup> Airborne Division front was very quiet
since the adoption of a defensive order by the 101<sup>st</sup>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Friendly patrol reports indicated that the enemy was also defending
forward positions in this sector with the mission of protecting the East-West
road through BERTOGNE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
of the enemy’s armor had been withdrawn from the salient.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Small groups of 2 or 3 tanks were observed however and encountered in the
strong-point defensive positions on the front.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Use of artillery by the enemy had been light for the past two days and
the Luftwaffe had failed to appear.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The enemy front at the close of the day consisted of a series of defended
positions as follows: BERTOGNE was occupied by the Germans but dominated from
the high ground east of the town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
general, the enemy was employing a mobile defense, consisting chiefly of
automatic weapons, small arms, and intense mortar fire along the route of
advance; he threw all he had and when about to be overcome, pulled out what
remained.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not use tanks or
SP’s to stem our advance to BERTOGNE, but he did employ tanks inside the city
itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was estimated that a
Battalion of enemy infantry, with flat trajectory anti-tank weapons, and
possibly other tanks were in the city itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Another critical point contested by the enemy was ROUETTE (west of
Longchamps) where small arms and automatic weapons fire was very heavy, until
the enemy realized his plight and evacuated.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At 0100 on the 13<sup>th</sup> of January orders came from CCA to attack
at 0900 and to seize and hold the high ground south of BERTOGNE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Attack was delayed and launched instead at 1010, preceded by heavy
artillery preparation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Leading
elements (Companies “B” and “C”) reached their first phase line at 1300,
reorganized, then pushed on and captured the high ground south of BERTOGNE where
the companies dug in and held positions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The enemy had not changed his tactics from the preceding day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was vigorously defending strong points along our advance, withdrawing
when overcome and then trying to retake his last ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He continued the use of small arms, automatic weapons and tank fire and
on our western flank extremely heavy mortar fire and on the eastern flank very
heavy anti-tank fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

the high ground with dug in infantry northeast of VILLEROUX.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>VAU was principally defended with tanks, nebelwurfers, and mortars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Early morning reports from patrols revealed little enemy activity behind
his lines nor did he employ his customary harassing artillery through the night
or day as in the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During the
daylight hours he continued his defense of strong points.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The woods east of NOVILLE with numerous anti-tank and flak weapons were
cleared at 1400, thus removing the threat in the city itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Battalion remained in reserve on these days carrying on maintenance
while the Staff Officers carried on reconnaissance missions along possible
routes of employment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A summary of the enemy situation at this time pointed to the following;
the enemy had withdrawn to the safety of his SIEGFRIED LINE positions and in
some instances had offered heavy resistance to further advances on our part
while in others resistance had only been moderate and halfhearted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Numerous prisoners of war had given themselves up after a show of
resistance, and morale generally appeared to be very low.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A penetration of the SIEGFRIED LINE had occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unless pressed, however, the enemy had been content to let well enough
alone and the lack of aggressiveness on the part of his patrols had been quite
noticeable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Division front, elements of three divisions had been identified
with an estimated top strength of 1800.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As far as reserves were concerned it was becoming apparent that the enemy
was reshuffling his Panzer Divisions to support a definite defensive policy in
the West,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>but there was no
indication that these divisions had been or could be refitted to such an extent
that they would constitute an offensive threat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Third Army zone, north of the MOSELLE, the enemy’s mobile
reserve was estimated at between 80 and 100 tanks, but no armor had been
reported in the zone of advance of this Division.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Artillery activity had been light for the most part and only harassing in
nature, while only one or two nightly reconnaissance flights had been reported.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Thus it was evident that the enemy did not at this time have any
offensive power in the West.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
not only on the defensive along the entire Western Front but he had no striking
power.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, approximately six
unlocated Panzer-type divisions gave him the capability of employing them in a
defensive role against penetrations of his position.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He could commit them in local attacks in an effort to prevent
breakthroughs and contain thrusts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
over all, the enemy currently had no offensive power in the West.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The quick seizure of the division objective by Reserve command, coupled
with the slower progress of the 90<sup>th</sup> Infantry division caused our
left flank to be exposed to hostile fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
minimize this danger, tanks and tank destroyers were brought forward on the 7<sup>th</sup>
and 8<sup>th</sup> of February and the Infantry Battalions consolidated and dug
in on the objective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While the 90<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division continued its advance, a
series of local actions took place, including the recapture of LUTZKAMPEN by the
CAVALRY, and the smashing of an enemy counter-attack in at least Company
strength by the Infantry.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Heavy enemy artillery and mortar fire necessitated a readjustment of the

to a more favorable position slightly to the west.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>A recapitulation of Corps activity from 5 to 11 February showed that in
the early morning attack by the corps on the 6<sup>th</sup> of February, the
enemy was caught off base and considerable surprise was achieved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

initially in the 4<sup>th</sup> Division sector, and later by the 90<sup>th</sup>
Division, 87<sup>th</sup> division, and 11<sup>TH </sup>ARMORED DIVISION.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was the deepest penetration of the line so far achieved in the EIFEL.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

initial line.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>OLZHEIM, HERMESPAND, GONDENBRETT, BRANDSCHEID, HABSCHEID, HECKHUSHEID,
and GROSSKEMPENBERG were captured but before the enemy yielded, heavy resistance
was offered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Invariably after each
village was taken intense artillery, mortar, and rocket fire was received in
order to deny us undisturbed possession.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
enemy had resisted all along the line to the utmost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Approximately 3,000 prisoners had been taken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The PRUM RIVER line was now being approached and with it the important
communications center of PRUM, where the enemy formerly marshaled many of his
units for commitment against this Corps as far back as October 1944.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Enemy artillery action was moderate to heavy, consisting principally of
harassing and inter-diction fires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Considerable
nebelwurfer fire was received as well as heavy rocket fire concentrations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, every defense possible was made to our advance.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Small groups of tanks and SP guns were employed and other undetermined

</span>The enemy divisions in contact on the VIII Corps front at this time
comprised one Armored Division and elements and remnants of 8 Infantry Divisions
totaling 11,400 men and 40 tanks plus and estimated total of 10 light artillery
battalions capable of firing into the VIII Corps area.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In addition to the above it was estimated that the enemy had in tactical

total of one Panzer Gr. Division and elements of 3 Panzer divisions, 8,000
combat troops, 100 tanks as well as organic artillery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

</span>An estimate of the enemy and general military situation at this time
tended to show that after a penetration of the SIEGFRIED LINE by this division
several days before, a general lull descended on our immediate front.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The enemy has taken advantage of this by sending out small patrols,
firing light to medium artillery fire of a harassing nature and conducting
small-scale repairs and improvements of his positions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>New boundaries assigned this division in this operation passed control of
the area of our penetration of the SIEGFRIED LINE to the 90<sup>th</sup>
Infantry Division on our north, thus making the intact SIEGFRIED LINE the enemy
front across our entire sector.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Prisoner
of War reports indicated that the enemy had engaged in a constant reshuffling of
small groups occupying individual pillboxes and bunkers in order to keep the men
fresh, active and make desertion more difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Desertions were frequent and morale of the German soldier was very low
due to a notorious lack of food, medical supplies, heavy weapons and
transportation facilities, and the deteriorating military situation in the East.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since February 6<sup>th</sup> the Division took 291 prisoners, the
majority of whom surrendered or deserted at their first opportunity, and VIII
Corps had taken 5,830 POWs in the operation which penetrated the SIEGFRIED LINE
on a broad front.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One division and possible elements of another were likely to be engaged
by this division in the coming offensive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Estimated combined troop strength of this force was 1,800 men and no tanks.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One could reasonably conclude from these observations that the enemy
would certainly attempt a defense of his SIEGFRIED LINE positions, although due
to the low morale now existing it was entirely possible that only half-hearted
resistance would be made by the individual soldier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The likelihood of more than local counter-attacks being made against this
division was very remote due to the Corps main effort being made to the East and
the encircling nature of the larger plan.</font><!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table><!--msnavigation--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
