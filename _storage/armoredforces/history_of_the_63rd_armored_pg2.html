with mortar and small arms fire and at 0500 he had even launched a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>CCA, swinging south and east into the 90<sup>th</sup> Infantry Division

mortar, nebelwurfer and high velocity fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>By 1600 of April 1<sup>st</sup> the enemy had been cleared to
KEITENSUNDHEIM along the SCHLITZ – SILGES – WENDERSHAUSEN axis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>CCA followed the CCB route.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No

</span>CCB jumped off early in the morning after liquidating GROSSENENIER and,
in coordination with the air support, overcame all resistance in its path.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Generally the towns were not defended, other like SIGLES, GOTTHARDS,
OBRNUST, LAHRBACH, and HENDATHURM were all set on fire when resistance in the
form of small arms, automatic weapons, and sniper fire was received.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Approximately 30 horse-drawn vehicles were knocked out in the enemy’s
attempted withdrawal along our axis of advance.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Arial"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

TASK FORCE BRADY moved out following TASK FORCE AHEE until the advance was
halted due to a traffic tie-up at SCHLITZ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

a position move.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At 1800 orders
