<p align="center"><b><u><font face="Arial">MY BROTHERS BY GERALD CAGLE</font></u></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I will never forget the day when, as a child, my mother took me into a back
room of our home to &quot;show me something.&quot; She began to show me those
military unit pictures on the wall that I had seen so many times, but did not
know their significance. I was no more than five or six years of age at the
time, maybe younger. She began to tell me about two brothers that I had that I
never had heard about. It was confusing for me, but exciting in an odd way.
There on those pictures were faces of someone I did not know, but were brothers
to me. I had two brothers still alive at that time, so I knew what it was like
to have brothers, but these felt different. What my mother told me that day,
became a life-long quest of trying to &quot;get to know&quot; two brothers that
I could never know in the true sense of the word.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I have forgotten much of what my mother told me that day, but I have never
forgotten what my brothers did in their service to our country. I have always
thought that if I could honor them in my heart, it would not matter very much if
no one else honored them. But as time has passed, I have realized that what they
did was important. They were no more, no less, than so many who went &quot;over
there.&quot; But these were <u>my</u> brothers. What they did in the war
mattered. For this, they, as well as all who served in World War II, should be
remembered by all. PFC Clyde F. Cagle and PFC George M. (Melton) Cagle paid the
ultimate price for the United States to remain free. This should never be taken
lightly. They truly are &quot;fallen heroes.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I have tried to ask questions down through the years to learn from family
members as much as I could about my brothers, but I could never get my family to
say very much. Until the day she died, my mother was the only one with whom I
could talk about my brothers openly and comfortably. It must have been so
painful for her, but she never told me to go away, or not to ask any more
questions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Being born after my brothers were killed, I could not in my youth, and still
cannot imagine what my family had experienced just a few years before. I might
add, they never recovered from their loss. How could a parent recover from this
kind of loss? At one point in World War II, my mother had three sons and five
brothers in service at the same time. How she must have worried. As far as I
know, all of them saw action, or were in battlefield theater of operations. One
of my brothers who was in service in World War II survived. Another brother
missed the draft.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">My brother, Richard, according to his discharge papers, departed from the U S
on March 15, 1944 and arrived in the Pacific Theater of Operations (APTO) on
March 21, 1944. He departed the APTO for the U S on January 19, 1946 and arrived
in the U S on January 25, 1946. He was discharged at the separation center at
Camp Shelby, Mississippi on February 2, 1946. T-5 William R. (Richard) Cagle was
in Battery B, 325<sup>th</sup> AAA Searchlight Battalion. He was responsible for
the requisitioning, receiving, and distributing of all publications for the
central Pacific Area.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Richard was my best friend. He was my big brother, my hero. He could do
&quot;everything&quot; in my eyes. He had some hard years after the war. He
could never talk to me about the other &quot;boys.&quot; He had some days of
deep, dark depression that would, at times, almost overwhelm him. These hard
years lasted until September 17, 1970. His heart gave out that day. I still
mourn the loss of the best friend that I ever had, but I treasure the memories
of the good times.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Clyde was in Co. L, 121<sup>st</sup> Regiment, of the 8<sup>th</sup>
Division. They went in Normandy on July 4, 1944. I know very little about the
battles that were fought, but the fighting must have been very intense. On July
12, 1944, Clyde was killed in action somewhere outside of St. Lo. He was killed
instantly by an 88.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">By e mail, I was given this information.</font></p>
<i>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;Based on info in the 121<sup>st</sup> Infantry Regimental History, your
brother was probably hit during an enemy counterattack near Hill 92 on the
outskirts of Laulne, France.&quot;</font></i> <font face="Arial"> Letters which survived from Clyde’s
platoon Sgt. just state it as outside of St. Lo. Another soldier gave me this
information.<i> &quot;I was a platoon Sgt. In the 83<sup>rd</sup> Infantry
Division at that time and we were driving towards St. Lo from the west. The 30<sup>th</sup>
Division and the 29<sup>th</sup> Division were coming from the north and the 8<sup>th</sup>
from the northeast. We started from Carentan, France after relieving the 101<sup>st</sup>
Airborne. I believe the 8<sup>th</sup> started about the same time or a few days
later. We started July 4, 1944 and by the 8<sup>th</sup> of July we were
involved in some of the heavy fighting of the war. I know because I was wounded
on July 17, 1944, just five days after Clyde was killed.&quot; </i>He goes on to
state that he was at Ft. McClellan when Clyde was there, but did not know him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I received this e mail from another who responded to Clyde’s story.</font></p>
<i>
<p><font face="Arial">&quot;I read your message on the ...Message Board with great interest. My
father served in the 8<sup>th</sup> division, 121<sup>st</sup> Infantry , Co. F.
He was wounded by shrapnel the day before your brother was killed. I showed your
message to my father and it brought back memories of how terrible the 88's were
and how the Germans would use them to kill individuals. After a period of
recuperation, my father rejoined the 121<sup>st</sup> in France. He fought in
Luxemburg and Germany before receiving &quot;a million-dollar wound&quot; - in
his case, a bullet to the leg - in late February of 1945 that sent him back to
England and, eventually, the United States. I’ve spent a lot of time talking
to him about the training they did for six months in Arizona in 1943, the
journey from New York Harbor to Northern Ireland in December 1943, the training
in Northern Ireland and his experiences in Europe. He didn’t know your
brother, but if I can be of any help to you in tracing his movements with the 8<sup>th</sup>
prior to being killed, please let me know.&quot;</font></p>
</i>
<p><font face="Arial">Clyde is buried in the Normandy - Colleville Cemetery.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Melton served in Co. D of the 786<sup>th</sup> Tank Battalion. The following
was related to me by someone who researched the activities of the 786<sup>th</sup>.</font></p>
<i>
<p><font face="Arial">The 786<sup>th</sup> was formed on 23 Sep, ‘43 at Camp Chaffee, Ark. It was
originally supposed to be the 1st Bn of the 47th Armored Regiment, but was later
changed to be an independent tank battalion. After training, the 786<sup>th</sup>
sailed from New York on 1 Dec,’ 44, arriving in England on 8 Dec ‘44. They
moved to France on 23 Jan, ‘45. In the next month they moved up to the front
along the German border, and on 23 Feb,’ 45 they were attached to the 99<sup>th</sup>
Infantry Division, an attachment they retained through the end of the war. After
brief occupation duty after VE Day, they sailed back into Boston on 6 Jul, ‘45
and were deactivated at Camp Gruber, OK on 8 Nov, ‘45.</font></p>
</i>
<p><font face="Arial">This information was sent to me by Clark J. Holloway whose father was in
Company A of the 786<sup>th</sup> Tank Battalion. It is taken from a book about
the 99<sup>th</sup> Division to which the 786<sup>th</sup> was attached. The
name of the book is &quot;Battle Babies,&quot; written by Major General Walter
E. Lauer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">According to Maj. Gen. Lauer, Company A of the 786th Tank Battalion and
Company D of the 786th Tank Battalion were attached to the 393rd Infantry
Regiment, which was a unit of the 99th Infantry Division. In early March, 1945,
the 99th Infantry Division was involved in the drive to the Rhine River.
Beginning on page 168 of Maj. Gen. Lauer's book, the movements of the 99th
Infantry Division are described as follows: <i>...the 99th Division began moving
up to its newly assigned front between Duren and Julich. It left Aubel early on
the morning of the 1st March in a drizzling rain. Extra motor transportation had
arrived, and the Division, now fully motorized, rolled out of its assembly area,
through the rubble of conquered Aachen, over the super-highway through
Eschweiler where heavy fighting had once taken place, through Duren and on to
the open plains near Elsdorf. These open fields and plains were a great chance
to our men who had become used to fighting in what is termed in military
parlance &quot;close country.&quot; No hills or extended forests, no muddy
trails and tortuous roads--but open country, where men could see for hundreds of
yards in all directions--see to shoot! This was a relief. Here one could attack
and expect to get results. We did--both! The general mission assigned our
Division was to force the Erft Canal and seize the low line of hills north of
the canal caled the &quot;Vorgebirge Mountains,&quot; so as to punch a hole
through the enemy line for the 3rd Armored Division to plunge through in its
drive for Cologne from the north, and at the same time to cover the north flank
of the VII Corps while driving to the Rhine. This placed the 99th Division as
the northernmost division of the First Army and on the immediate south flank of
the Ninth Army. As we arrived at Elsdorf that night the weather cleared, a full,
bright moon came out, and at about 11 P.M. a vist by Jerry planes welcomed us.
They greeted us with enthusiasm, straffing and dropping bombs on our locations
and all along the main supply route. They did a thorough job--just like a kid
running along a row of houses ringing doorbell after doorbell--so did Jerry drop
his bombs. Starting at one end of town, he came right down the line, from front
to rear and farther out along the main road, laying eggs, one cluster after
another, missing nothing. It was his welcome, to let us know that he knew where
we were! We took it. The question was, could he take it when we started to dish
it out? Early on the morning of the 2nd March the Division started its advance.
The 393rd Infantry led out, with the 4th Cavalry Group, attached to the
Division, preceding it. They crossed the Erft Canal near the town of Glesh and
began their drive to the northeast, skirting along the canal. Before noon the
cavalry group had secured the little town of Winkelheim and Buchholz. There the
3rd Battalion Infantry, in the lead, passed through the cavalry, and the two
units jointly drove on to capture the town of Neurath which fell at 7:00 P.M.
Our troops were galloping ahead so fast that when a phone rang at a coal briquet
factory in Neurath, with the home office at Dusseldorf calling to find out where
the Americans were, a lineman from the 99th Signal Company offered first-hand
information. The town of Bedburg, naturally called Bedbug by our men, was taken
over and cleared by the 1st Battalion 393rd Infantry, while the 2nd Battalion
393rd did the same to the town of Buchholz, so that the speed of our advance
elements would not be slowed. That first day netted us about 320 prisoners of
war. Opposition was relatively light, consisting mostly of small arms, mortar
and the direct fire of anti-tank weapons. The resistance which the low hills and
open terrain of the &quot;Vorgebirge&quot; range west of the Rhine afforded the
enemy to offer our advance was much less than expected. This type of fighting
was a cinch for our men, who had been used to crawling over real, steep hills
and through heavy forests. Elements from five German divisions and a number of
&quot;cat-and-dog&quot; outfits were encountered. There was only one conclusion
to draw from this situation--the enemy was confused and surprised and trying to
get away--he was fighting a spotty and haphazard rear guard action. The
remainder of the 99th Division had staged up from Aubel, and the 394th Infantry
crossed the Erft Canal that day and went into an assembly area north of Bergheim
and west of Weidenfeld, ready to jump off in an attack the next morning. Our
Combat Team 395 was still operating with the 3rd Armored Division, immediately
south of our zone, breaking out a hole for the armored division to plunge
through in its planned drive for Cologne. The morning of March 3 saw our drive
really get under way. We started hammering away with two regiments, the 393rd
and the 394th, and had the 4th Cavalry Group speed its armor along the east bank
of the Erft Canal to cover the left flank of the Division. The list of towns
overrun and captured as the reports kept pouring in that day sounded like a
railroad time schedule: Allrath, Heyderhof, Barrenstein, the Erftwerke factory
area, Muchhausen, Fraumeiler, Rath, Vanikum, Rommerskirchen, Huchelhoven, Gill,
Sinsteden, etc., etc. There was no doubt about it, our men had blood in their
eyes, they were on the offensive, and they were enjoying this
&quot;ladling-it-out&quot; for a change. P.O.W.s kept rolling in--351 were
captured in action, and more were to be gathered in later who had fled,
deomoralized. Our 324the Engineer Battalion did in twelve hours what was
normally a two-day job. That morning they completed throwing two Bailey bridges
across the Erft Canal near the town of Bedburg. Those bridges gave us the much
needed security of additional crossings so that in the event hostile air attacks
knocked out a bridge we would not be cut off from supply and evacuation and as a
result be slowed down in our drive. That day, too, our drive opened the way to
Cologne for the 3rd Armored Division, so C.T. 395 reverted back to the Division,
but was held in reserve temporarily. We sent its 3rd Battalion, however, from
Bergheim to Neurath, where it relieved the 2nd Battalion 393rd Infantry. The 3rd
Battalion 395th Infantry, however, was in an offensive mood and launched an
attack at 5:30 P.M. to capture the town of Sinsteden, which fell to them at 7:40
P.M. The German rear guard was collapsing fast. The 4th Cavalry Group, which had
been operating under the 99th Division and which under its doughty commander,
Colonel John McDonald, had gained the praise and admiration of all in the
Division with whom it had come in contact, was pulled away from the 99th that
afternoon to join the 3rd Armored Division. We regretted its loss, but that was
not the last we saw of it during the operation. It continued to operate on our
right (south) flank, and later still took over our entire front. The 4th Cavalry
Group as a fine fighting outfit. In its drive that day the &quot;Battle
Babies&quot; had advanced over 9000 yards along the Erft Canal and swept east
across the entire width of its zone, knocking out the enemy strong points
established in every town and village overrun. Late that afternoon the
resistance encountered stiffened considerably on the front of the 934th Infantry
near Rommerskirchen, where enemy tanks and self-propelled guns reinforced the
enemy strong points. Spotty resistance of this sort was to be expected. It was
disorganized rear guard action. The Krauts were doing what they could to delay
our advance and thereby permit the flower of their army a chance to sneak across
the Rhine. The answer to that was to hit them twice as hard and fast. We did!
Intelligence reports indicated that we were faced by elements from seven German
divisions: 9th Panzer, 363rd V.G., 361st V.G., 59th Infantry, 11th Panzer, 340th
and 476th Infantry Divisions. Seven German divisions against two American
regiments! Impossible--but true. There remained only one conclusion to draw: the
enemy was disorganized, confused and probably demoralized. Whatever resistance
we were to meet would be of a purely local nature, depending upon the character
of the local commander. [footnote: One Jerry tank commander captured was
thoroughly disgusted. He said he got orders to &quot;turn your guns around
against the Americans and do not retreat another inch.&quot; He did, he said. He
wheeled his guns around to face the enemy, then switched off the ignition and he
and his crews went into a farmhouse where they slept until captured. Said he:
&quot;I followed orders!&quot;] Our morale was high! Our wish was being
answered! What a difference from dark, dismal December! [i.e., during the Battle
of the Bulge] Starting an hour before sunrise the 4th March, the 99th Division
hurled its whole weight at the enemy resistance. Before the day was done the
Division had advanced 19,000 yards on an 11,000 yard front. Nothing could stop
our men. They galloped over the countryside beating down all the small, isolated
groups of the enemy which resisted their advance. The desultory small arms and
mortar fire encountered gave evidence of the lack of determination on the part
of the enemy. Hostile artillery fire from deep rear areas which fell on the town
as we captured them was the chief obstacle encountered. Enemy morale was being
broken. The Nazi could act with ruthless sadism when he was in the saddle and
succeeding, but cowered and fled when the tables were reversed and our men
advanced in straightforward fighting. The regiments captured over 519 P.O.W.s,
many of them sorry specimens of the Wehrmacht's supermen, during this second day
of fighting. Fifty towns and smaller communities were overrun--to list them
would be just calling the roll of all the towns in the area. Quantities of
German equipment and arms started falling into our hands. For example, that day
the 393rd Infantry alone captured and turned in three 88 mm guns, three
half-tracks, one personnel carrier, between 400 and 500 rifles, and a small arms
ammunition dump. Another unit captured an enemy tank with its crew of five
asleep in it. There was no doubt remaining, the Boche were running away, and
with it all, fighting a poor rear guard action. In this kind of fighting it was
found that the regiments could operate better as combat teams, that is, each
regiment organized as a complete fighting team within itself. To the 393rd
Infantry was attached the 370th F.A. Battalion, 372nd F.A. Battalion (M.),
Company A 324th Medical Battalion, Company A 629th T.D. Battalion, Company A
786th Tank Battalion, and Light Tank Company D 786th Tank Battalion. The 99th
Reconnaissance Troop was also attached to the 393rd Infantry, and using this
troop as the nucleus, the famous &quot;Task Force Leuders&quot; was organized.
This task force consisted of the 99th Reconnaissance Troop of armored vehicles,
Company D 786th Tank Battalion, and Company A 629th Tank Destroyer Battalion to
give it heavy fire power. Mounted on these vehicles, riding wherever they could,
was added an infantry company, Company C 393rd Infantry. &quot;Task Force
Leuders&quot; thereby became a rapid moving, hard hitting force which
accomplished the unexpected an extraordinary. For example, spearheading ahead of
the 393rd Infantry on the 4th March, it made a lightning thrust to capture the
town of Norf, close to the Rhine, then without stop quickly seized the town of
Derikum farther east and thereby sealed off all chances for the Germans to slip
out of the pocket between the Erft Canal and the Rhine River which our drive had
created. Our &quot;Task Force Leuders,&quot; &quot;T.F.L.&quot; to us and the
&quot;Teufel&quot; to the Jerries, was doing its best to corral all the
Goebbel's men who were going to defend every inch of Der Vaterland to the last
man. We wanted them all--to the last man--in spite of the fact that many of them
had a good head start, running for the Rhine.</i> ------------ End extract from
&quot;Battle Babies&quot;. On March 5th, the 393rd Infantry reached the banks of
the Rhine. The 99th Infantry later crossed the Rhine over the bridge at Remagen,
headed southeast, then turned north to drive the Germans into the &quot;Ruhr
Pocket&quot;.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I thank Clark very much for the effort he put forth to send me this material.
It seems that my brother, Melton, was in a very effective fighting unit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Melton was killed accidentally as he was cleaning the machine gun on his tank
on March 3, 1945. I have never understood how this happened, but I have been
told that it was a fairly common accident. My parents never did find out any
more than this about Melton’s death. I don’t think that they really wanted
to know.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Melton’s death was a terrible blow to my parents who had already lost one
son. I have heard that upon the arrival of those who informed my parents of
Melton’s death, that my mother said with much despair, &quot;Not again.&quot;
I have tried to picture that scene. The fear of seeing that military car pull
into the yard must have been unbearable. I think that all parents have a
horrible fear of losing one of their children. Think of losing two sons to a war
that was being fought in such a distant land. Two sons who left in tears,
promising to come back home soon, but were never to be seen again. Melton is
buried in the Henri - Chapelle Cemetery in Belgium.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Melton’s death was such a shock that my parents didn’t even fill out and
return the form for his life insurance. In all of the turmoil in their lives,
they must have just forgotten. It may be that they just could not bring
themselves to receive any money for the death of another son. They had been
convinced to do so at Clyde’s death, but my daddy always thought that
receiving this money was the same as receiving &quot;blood money.&quot; He just
didn’t think that it was right to accept payment for the death of his son.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">All of this was forgotten over the years, but was discovered in the late
70's. It created quite a stir in the Veterans Administration when they found
this out that parents of a deceased veteran who died in a foreign country in
time of war were not receiving his life insurance benefits, even though he was
not killed in action. An investigation revealed that the form had not been
returned, so there was nothing that could be done. It was discovered at this
time, though, that my parents should have been receiving much more money over
the years. I am not sure of the reason for the underpayment, but the VA did
correct this problem at this time. How much easier it could have been in years
past for my parents if they could have been drawing this larger amount. I
remember how badly my family needed this small amount every month. It wasn’t
much (maybe $40 or so), but it did put some food on the table. It seems to this
day a very small amount for all that they lost. What price could be put on the
lives of two sons? How much would really be enough?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Below are letters which are priceless to me. Most of these were mailed to my
grandfather, W.A. Cagle. I have no letters sent home to my parents from Clyde. I
have no letters at all from or to Melton. I can't imagine the loss of two sons
anytime, but especially in war and to never see them again because they chose to
have them buried overseas. They must have destroyed or lost</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Clyde's letters home and I have no idea of letters from and to Melton. My
cousin found these to my grandfather and gave them to me.</font></p>

be sent to some other compound I don’t know where that will be. Me and Jake,
Elmer and Elbert are in the same company together. Me and Jake sleeps in the

grown since I saw him last. I bet Stanley don’t care anything about him I mean
he does. I am liking my new camp all right. It has really been cold here. I
think it has been as low as 10 or 15 degrees below zero. We have barracks as
good as any house to stay in. Our barracks are heated by one big furnace. We don’t
have to worry about fire for there is one man that keeps fire all day and all
night. This is about all I have to write this time.</font></p>

letter which I was glad to get. I was glad to hear that all of you were doing
pretty well. Yes, I know about Richard getting his call. I hated to hear about
it but it can’t be helped. I am not having much of a hard time. Some time I
have to work harder than at other. I haven’t been doing anything much for the
last week only to classes and studying the weapons we use in our company. Most
of the work we do is walking and digging slit trenches. We have to walk Guard
about every 12 days. I don’t like it much but it is not much bad. You don’t
get to sleep much when on Guard. We have to Guard Prisoners too. Alton I guess
you and Molly and children are doing all right to. When I write a letter to any
of you I mean it for all. I will send some of my picture when I get some. We can’t
hardly get any films to have pictures made. We are going to leave this camp
pretty soon. Some of them say that we are going on maneuvers. I don’t know
whether we are or not but I wouldn’t doubt it. I haven’t seen Elmer but one
time since we have parted. This company has been quarantined because of the
mumps and I haven’t been going anywhere. Me and Jake is still together. This

Melton being at home on furlough. I am glad he got it. I was surprised to hear
about Roy getting another furlough. I believe that makes him two. It is good
that he can get to come home now while he is in the States. I hope him and
Melton don't have to come across. Maybe they won't. I'll be glad when all of us
can come back across. It is good that Wade is close enough that he can come home
pretty often. I guess he is still liking his job. I haven't heard from Howard
since we have been over here. I don't have his address or I would write him. I
wrote him just before we left the states. Cecil got a letter from you today. I
don't know if he has answered it yet or not. I guess this is all for now. I will
close for now. Keep everything going.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">I guess you will wonder who I am but I am Ed Ray. I was your son Clyde’s
platoon sgt. And I got wounded in France. I want to tell you that Clyde was a
very dear friend of mine. I was with him when he got killed. We were about ten
miles from St. Lo. Some time about the 9th of July. We got cut off by the
Germans. Our company lost about 25 men in that same battle. Clyde was with me.
They was only a few of us left. I got up and started around a fence. Clyde
called me and ask me did I want him to come. And I told him yes. And about that
time I heard some shells coming and I hit the ground and after they hit I run
back. And there lay Clyde with his face down on his machine gun. He never did
speak after he was hit. He had been with me ever since he come to Fort Leonard
Wood, Mo. He was just like a brother to me. And one of the best soldiers. No
body felt his death more than me. I can say it and tell the truth he was one of
the cleanest living boys I have ever met. I have heard him talk about his home
and I wonder it is a awful price to pay in war. But I am lucky to be here. I
will stop this time.</font></p>

Unfortunately, reports of this nature contain only the briefest details as they
are prepared under battle conditions and the means of transmission are limited.

<p><font face="Arial">This letter was sent to my uncle, Uncle John, (mentioned above) who was
medically discharged just before he was to be shipped overseas.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Tuesday night December 5 1944</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Hello John,</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I received your letter while I was on a furlough. Sure was glad to hear from
you. John, about Clyde we went in France July 4th and fought from there on most
up the boys either got wounded or killed. Perry Lt. Huffham, CC Knight, Johnes,
Hunt, all got killed the first day. Me, Hoare, McCuistion, Adkins got wounded.
Oh yes Sgt. Thompson got killed, Bradley too.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">John, a 88 shell got me, and that is what got Clyde. We was pinned down and
the captain sent me to bring them up closer. I got up and started. And Clyde
followed me. And he forgot his gun. And he went back to get it. And just as he
picked up it a shell hit him it went through him. And I run to him but he never
did speak one word. I got the gun out from under him and laid him on his back.
And that is about all they was to it. Hoare ,McCuistion ,Adkins got wounded the
same time. I can say Clyde was a good boy one of the best. And I felt it as if
it had been a brother of mine. Well John, when you find time write. So long.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">It is with deep regret that I confirm the telegram of recent date informing
you of the death of your son, Private First Class George M. Cagle, 34,636,747,
Infantry.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The official casualty report states that your son was killed on 3 March 1945
in Neurath, Germany. The report further states that he was killed accidentally
by a machine gun of tank while cleaning the weapon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I fully understand your desire to receive as much information as possible
concerning his death. Recently provisions were made whereby there will be sent
directly to the emergency addressee or the next of kin a letter containing
further information about each person who dies overseas in the service of our
country, and if this letter has not already been received, it may be expected
soon.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">I sincerely regret that this message must carry so much sorrow into your home

<p><font face="Arial">It should be noted that some of the names and other words of the original
letters were very hard, if not impossible, to read. But, they are as close to
being correct as was possible for me.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">There will be other information, I am sure, that I will come across that
could be entered here, and I will enter it if it does become available. There
are many other things that I would like to know about my brothers, but my
knowledge will never be complete in this life. I am thankful to know as much as
I do about their lives and their sacrifices for their country. What they did
ultimately bought my freedom. I thank God for them and I thank them for being
willing to do what they could.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">If you know someone who served in World War II, or in war in another time,
honor them. If they are alive, tell them that you love them and appreciate them
for their service for your freedom. They are worthy of the honor, even though
they would humbly say that they didn’t do much of anything. May God bless
their memories to our hearts and our very lives that we will not forget what
they did &quot;over there.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Many years ago someone said it much better than I ever could. It refers to a
different war in a different time, but the truths written therein are applicable
to all generations.</font></p>
<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on
this</font></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated
to the</font></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are
engaged in</font></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any
nation so</font></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a
great</font></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion

<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">that field as a final resting-place for those who here gave
their</font></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting

<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">The brave men, living and dead who struggled here have

<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought
here</font></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be
here</font></i></p>
<p align="center"><i><font face="Arial">dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from
