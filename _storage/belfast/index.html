            <p align="left"><font face="Arial">By 1917 Belfast was bustling with activity. At the
            center of town was the community well complete with pump and
            watering trough for thirsty horses, livestock, chickens, town pets
            and their owners. To the side of the well stood a round bandstand,
            one and a half stories high, where since 1912 the then famous
            Belfast Band played for concerts under flickering gasoline
            torchlight.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Cattle drives proceeding through town accompanied by a
            well-trained stock dog were a common occurrence of the time. John
            and Alec Easter were the local cattlemen (later joined by John's
            son, Starley Easter and his stock dog, Brownie) who bought livestock
            directly from the farmers, then drove the cattle or hogs on foot to
            market in Hillsboro or further onto Cincinnati.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">&quot;About 400 yards south of the center of town&quot; and
            &quot;located on Brush Creek&quot; was Belfast Roller Mills operated
            by Edgar Williamson and his uncle, William A. Williamson. Using
            steam power and four-foot wood as fuel, the power generated was also
            used for an adjacent saw mill and planing mill. The mill was named
            for the rollers which crushed the wheat into a fine white flour with
            &quot;by-products of bran and midlings.&quot; Corn meal and horse
            feed were also produced here.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Customers (mostly farmers) came &quot;in all kinds of horse drawn
            vehicles, bringing in their home-grown grain and taking home the
            ground product.&quot; Often a customer would arrive on horseback
            with a two-bushel sack of grain in front of him. The mill became
            &quot;a meeting place for farmers from miles around.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Belfast had two blacksmith shops. Ed Gustin had his shop south of
            Milligan's store where he shoed horses and &quot;was a wonder at
            working hot iron.&quot; Williamson relates that &quot;many an hour
            was spent by the youngsters of the town watching him pull the
            white-hot iron from the forge and hammer it into everything from
            tools to plowshares&quot; and he was a great story teller.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The other shop was located east of the Odd Fellows Hall and was
            operated by David (Mitt) Hottinger. He shoed horses and reworked
            broken and damaged buggy wheels that required iron work and welding.
            Mitt excelled as a fiddler and once won a fiddlin' contest hands
            down with the playing of a tune called &quot;Jumpin'
            Toothache.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Belfast had its share of good carpenters, a barber, a dedicated
            doctor and the ever necessary undertaker who usually made the wooden
            coffins used in his business, himself.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Dr. T.W. Roberts (T. for Thomas) had his office next to his home,
            which stood across the street from the Odd Fellows Hall. &quot;He
            was the typical country doctor and his rig pulled by his faithful
            horse was to be seen in all hours of the day and night traveling the
            local roads through snow and high water to administer to the
            sick,&quot; (there must be a special place in heaven for the
            old-fashioned country doctor). (10) In time he replaced his horse
            and rig for a Maxwell automobile which soon gained the reputation
            around town of being a &quot;cantankerous&quot; car &quot;with a
            mind of its own.&quot; Dr. Roberts discovered a treatment for blood
            poisoning involving the use of an antiseptic oil (eupinol) and cured
            many patients in his day.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Among the other town occupations was broom making, a creamery and
            a hack line operated by Cliff Calvert. He used a wagon and horses
            for a one trip per day run from Belfast to Hillsboro. He later
            changed to using a Model T truck to haul the freight.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">About this time an electric generating plant was constructed in
            the township that brought the first electric lights for Belfast
            businesses and residents.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The main businesses in town were the three general stores grouped
            around the town's center where the bandstand stood by the well.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The store to the south sold groceries, notions and sundry
            supplies but it served mainly as the Belfast Post Office. Cecil
            Milligan ran the store and he also officiated as Postmaster. The
            mail was brought into Belfast from Hillsboro (11 miles away) by a
            two horse rig which arrived each day before noon. &quot;The mail was
            sorted and taken on the rural route by Bill Nolan.&quot; In time the
            business was sold to Owen P. Lyle &quot;who continued to operate it
            and the post office.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">On the corner at the intersection stood the store owned by John
            W. Hurst. He operated it with one clerk, Tom McGuire for many years
            and sold all kind of staples and dry goods. Around Christmas the
            interior took on the glow of Yuletide with a dazzling display of
            decorations, gifts and toys. Later when automobiles gained in number
            and popularity, the store was sold to Chester Kier who remodeled it
            into a repair shop and garage.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Standing to the north of the other stores and facing the Belfast
            Hotel (home of the Swongers) was the general store owned and
            operated by Lon Swonger. Since the elderly Mr. Gilmore's retirement
            from the business, Lon had expanded the store's merchandise to
            include just about everything needed by the local community. Besides
            the sale of groceries his stock included clothing, shoes, dry goods,
            hardware, paints, automobile accessories, stoves, galvanized
            roofing, seed, fertilizer, wire fencing, feed for livestock, oil,
            gasoline, kerosene and even dynamite. By now, Lon's business affairs
            also included lumbering, but his main concern was in finding
            desirable items of merchandise for the store from the surrounding
            area (and on occasion further afield).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">A customer upon entering the store would note that the floor was
            of tongue-grooved oak ( which was typical of the retail stores of
            the time). It was routinely brushed down with oil (applied by a
            long-handled brush or mop) to preserve the wood; this also kept down
            the dust making it easier to sweep.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Below the wall-shelves of merchandise and groceries were bins
            containing various kinds of beans, sugar (white and brown), salt,
            flour, and rice. Pickles and crackers came loose in large barrels.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Toward the back of the store stood a giant ice box that took a
            half of a huge block of ice (it was not electric) where bacon,
            baloney, cheese, butter, milk and cold bottles of soda pop were
            kept. Off to the side was a door leading into a large storeroom
            where the first thing to the right was the salt fish barrel with a
            lid on top and a pointed wooden stick for removing fish from the
            barrel. The fish had to be soaked in water overnight before cooking
            and were eaten both as a breakfast or dinner staple.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">A long counter in front of the back wall displayed a scale over
            which hung a sizable bunch of bananas, next a hand-operated meat
            slicer, then a coffee grinder with the coffee beans in a bin nearby.
            Back here near the ice box was also kept a &quot;hoop of
            cheese,&quot; longhorn wrapped in cheese cloth which came in a round
            wooden container. The cheese had a red protective film and was cut
            off in wedges so was often called &quot;redskin cheese.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">To the left of the front door were three glass showcases with
            room to walk between them and behind. The first was full of candy
            and gum. The second held an array of tobacco products such as pipes,
            cigarettes and cigars with canned tobacco (Prince Albert and Sir
            Walter Raleigh) displayed nearby on a back shelf. The third showcase
            contained clothing items such as socks and handkerchiefs along with
            pocket watches, lighters and other small miscellaneous items. A good
            display of pocket knives sat atop the counter.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">The wall shelves behind the glass cases held boxes of shoes,
            overshoes and boots, along with stacks of overalls, shirts, jackets,
            coats and underwear. The cash register was on a wall counter between
            the second and third show cases. The store's wall phone (an old type
            with a crank handle) was located back on the corner wall. A common
            prank of the time was to receive a call from a tobacco customer who
            would ask, &quot;Do you have Prince Albert in the can?&quot; When
            the reply was, &quot;Yes, we do . . . &quot; the caller would
            rejoin, &quot;Well, let him out!&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">Beyond the show cases toward the rear of the store sat a big
            &quot;mogul&quot; potbellied, coal stove that amply provided
            luxuriating warmth on chilly, damp or downright cold days and
            nights. Arranged around the stove were some wooden rounded-backed
            chairs along with a few makeshift seats constructed from crates and
            old boxes. Down on the floor, two or three wooden ash boxes were
            placed there for spitting, along with a wide-mouth cuspidor
            (spittoon) for the tobacco chawers. The locals (generally men) met
            here at nights to share local news and discuss what was happening in
            the world.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial">A big room above the store served for a time as a meeting place
            for the Knights of Pythias Lodge and by the Grange (both active
            men's lodges of that day). Occasionally (most likely initiation
            nights), the shenanigans upstairs would sound close to bringing down
            the ceiling upon all below, and as an <em>old timer </em>recounts
            it, one of the idlers around the stove would remark to his group,
            &quot;I wonder who is riding the goat tonight?&quot;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Later with the passage of time, this upstairs area
            would one day be used for storage of Christmas toys and other items,
            and two young brothers would carve their initials in the wooden door
            guarding the stairway to the room above and its treasures. But in
            1917 I was still but a twinkle in my bachelor father's eye (as the
            saying goes . . . ), and his busy merchant's life left no room for
            romance, much less marriage . . . or so it appeared.</font></p>
