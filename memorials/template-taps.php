        <font face="Verdana">Dad and I were old comfortable pals. I have a few
            memories I'd like to share with you. When I was about 8 years old, he figured it
            was time for me to learn to play golf. This meant caddying for him at Fort
            Belvoir, Army Base. We'd drive out in the pitch black, shivering in the over
            air-conditioned car, smoking a huge cigar and listening to some old fogy AM DJs,
            Hardin and Weever. We were the very first twosome to T-off. It's still pre-dawn.
            He'd buy me a supply of Caravel bars and celebratory Sprite for the 18th hole.
            It was in the eerie misty dawn that I'd hear some of his great and famous
            stories of the ferocious icy Battle of the Bulge in the Ardennes, unloading
            ships in some hot and dusty port in North Africa, landing the entire 2nd Armored
            Division tank battalion in one of the worst storms at Omaha Beach, on D-3,
            getting shot by German snipers at close range and, with a glint in his eye,
            besting Old Blood and Guts Patton in some wild goose chase of half tracks and
            jeeps in the Louisiana Maneuvers. Just as the sun was rising, it was just me and
            Dad...and Peewee Collier, General Harmon, ID. White, General Patton and that
            dirty rotten scoundrel Rommel.. To this day I can't meet a German without
            stifling an urge to &quot;grab him by the nose and kick him in the ass&quot;. I
            would get tired pulling his golf clubs from hole to hole and I noticed a great
            gismo some other lucky soul had.. a little chair that attached to the golf bag.
            I informed Dad that I'd be a much better caddy if I could just have one of
            those. I knew he loved gismos. In his inimitable style, he just nodded and said
            it would make the bag much heavier. &quot;no&quot;, I declared, &quot;it
            wouldn't&quot;. Well, next Saturday, there was my little 50 pound stool. From
            then on, he pulled the bag with one a, which still gave him a big warm free hand
            to pull me too. ...Finally, I've become obsessed in family genealogy. Dad
            successfully feigned enough interest that I papered his apartment with drafts,
            updates, revisions on the drafts and interim updates of the Cox family history.
            It turns out that he comes from a long line of military men. His dad was a Dough
            Boy in WWI, his two great grandfathers were each officers in the Civil War, one
            in the Union 4th Tennessee Infantry and the other in the Confederate Tennessee
            Calvary and his great grandfather was an officer in the War of 1812. Here is
            what I'm picturing...each of these handsome soldiers is standing at attention in
            full dress uniform waiting for him at the pearly gates. Dad smartly marches up,
            dressed to the T's wearing all of his medals and ribbons, salutes Saint Peter,

                who did everything that was necessary and saw no reason to not do what was

            <b><u>Lane,&nbsp; Major Robert A.: </u></b>Born 25January 1913 -23 August
            1944.&nbsp; Robert was born&nbsp; in Marietta, Ohio, graduated from Marietta
            High School in 1930, and that September entered Ohio State University.&nbsp;
            Four years later, he graduated from OSU, in June, and in August married LaVerne
            Shaffer. On December, 1940&nbsp;&nbsp; left Fort Meade, Md with Lt. Ralph
            Luman and others for Fort Benning, Ga.&nbsp; They were activated and assigned to the Second Armored
            Division, land were trained under Gen. Patton. .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
            Before the
            holidays in 1942, he had to say good-bye to LaVerne and his children.&nbsp; Lt. Lane stayed with the 2nd
            Armored Division throughout
            his service. Far from his wife and family, Bob celebrated his 30th birthday with
            his 2nd Armored friends in the cork forest, the Foret de Mamora, near Rabat,
            French Morocco. That Christmas, spent in Morocco, was mild compared to the damp,
            cold &quot;Merry Olde&quot; English Christmas at Tidworth Barracks in 1943.
            Going from Africa to Sicily to England was quite a contrast, to include the
            intense heat the men experienced during and after the battle for Sicily.&nbsp;
            Promoted to Major, Bob became the S-2 for Combat Command B before they sailed into Normandy, June
            1944.&nbsp; He advanced through the<br>
            hedgerows, taking part in the breakthrough at St. Lo, passed the Falaise Gap, to
            Conches, France.<br>
            At the
            forward command post near Conches, France on Wednesday afternoon<br>
            23,August&nbsp; he was struck in the back by exploding Nebelwefer (Commonly
            known as &quot;Screaming Meenie&quot; rockets.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Robert
            A. Lane is buried at the Normandy American Cemetery at Omaha beach with 134 of
            his friends in the Second Armored Division. Respectfully, Sandra Lane Walker,

            to get the newest trinket from down the Avenue You loved us well, quietly and
            unconditionally. See the bronze medal, Uncle Bud was in the war so he doesn't
            say much--seemed logical to a 10 year old. The magnitude and effects of war only
            become clearer as I get older You went to help a world in trouble quietly and
            unconditionally Thanksgiving dinner, we'd sit next to each other every time!

            with Co. C, 67th Armor Reg 2d
            Armored Division., 24 Feb 42-27 Jun 45. He received 7 Bronze Stars and the
            Bronze Star Medal. He was a T-Sgt. with Charlie Co's Motor Pool. He fought in
            French-Morocco, Sicily, Normandy, Northern France, Ardennes, Central Europe,
            Rhineland, African campaigns. He never mentioned to any of this to his 3
            daughters or his grand-kids (one of which is me).&nbsp; Although my mom tells me
            he was troubled by dreams right up to the end. I include the eulogy that the
            priest read today for your information: Eulogy: I liked Harvey.
            Sister Olivia and I would bring him communion in his room at Heartland and it
            was always a pleasure. Before he moved to Girlie Manor he was able to come to
            Mass in his wheelchair. He struck me as a good an decent man; I liked his sense
            of humor. I couldn't believe he was 89 years old, and I told him so. I'm sure
            that Harvey knew that to be true because growing older had changed his life so
            much. Betty was gone, his sister and brothers were gone, his ability to work
            with his hands was of another time. So much had passed, including his health. I
            understand that Harvey had a few enjoyments in life, some he maintained as best
            he could. Fishing was of another time, but when he did fish he could frustrate
            those sitting next to him who were catching nothing and Harvey was pulling in a
            walleye. Harvey didn't need a lot of excitement to keep him going, his vocation
            as a mechanic was his reason to get going in the morning. When St. Paul says
            that we don't live for ourselves, that certainly was Harvey. If a farmer had a
            breakdown, Harvey would drop everything and get him back in the field. A family
            from Kentucky passing through had car problems, not only did Harvey get their
            car going, he had them stay with his family 2 or 3 days until he got it done!
            What a lesson for the kids! Even though some paper dolls went missing after they
            left, that doesn't keep you from meeting peoples needs. Harvey might have
            appeared a little gruff on the outside, but he had genuine sympathy for others,
            especially children, and so on the inside he was a teddy bear. That's certainly
            one reason why children were drawn to him. Excitement wasn't something that
            Harvey sought out; simple things were. Later in life he would steer telephone
            conversations to the point where he would ask if you would pick-him-up a
            cheeseburger and apple pie at McDonalds. He even got a road crew working in
            front of his house to get them once! He was a regular at Culvers drive-up for
            &quot;just a little bit of ice-cream.&quot; Diabetes couldn't have the total
            say. Maybe the reason he didn't search out excitement was because he had enough
            of it thrust at him during the war. As our first reading said: &quot;there will
            be a time for war, like it or not&quot;. Harvey never talked much about it, and
            he certainly never bragged about it, it was far too disturbing and humbling an
            experience for that. He relived it in his dreams, and I'm sure he was glad upon
            being awakened, to find that he was already back home. Perhaps he dreamt about
            the time that a tank became stuck in battle, and the crew faced certain death.
            How he managed to remove the tank-and-crew from danger for which he received a
            bronze star. Or perhaps it was one of the other events for which he received and
            additional 6 bronze stars. Harvey may well have figured he was just doing his
            job, as a soldier, and as a Christian who believed in putting ones life on the
            line for others. Our first reading also spoke of there being a time to build and
            a time to tear down.&nbsp;</font>
    </p>
    <p align="left">
        <font face="Verdana"> As a mechanic, Harvey did both, all the time. But as age
            sapped his physical strength, and he felt more and more beyond repair himself,
            he asked just the opposite of Martha in the gospel. She wondered why the Lord
            had not been present so that her brother Lazarus would not have died. Harvey,
            I'm told, has been prepared to die for quite some time. And it would bother him
            to hear of the death of a child or young person, when he himself remained. He'd
            say, &quot;I don't know why God wont take me.&quot; Or he'd say, &quot;This is
            my last Christmas.&quot; He said it so many times that last year when he said
            it, you couldn't have know that he was speaking the truth. This Christmas he
            would have been on the eve of his 90th birthday, instead, he has become ageless,
            in the presence of our eternal God. Harvey was proud of his grandchildren, and
            of his own children, the girls, although that's often harder to show. Now we
            present Harvey to our Heavenly Father, and without a doubt, Harvey will be shown
            just how proud God is of him. (contributed by his grandson Scott V. Savage)</font>

            to have spent a lot of time around airborne personnel, apparently both 101 and
            82 divisions, and knew street names in Bastogne. Recited history of Remagen

            9 January 2002). It is with a saddened heart that I inform you of the passing
            of my father. Dad was a member of the 2nd Armored Division from July 1944
            through Jan 1946, serving with &quot;C&quot; Company of the 82nd Recon
            Battalion. He was trained at Ft Knox, Ky. He received the Purple Heart from
            enemy action somewhere between Aachen and Colonge Germany in October of 1944,
            when a German 88mm fired upon Dad and his platoon near a barn. He received the
            Campaign Medal with silver star, good conduct, and victory medals, along with
            the Presidential Unit Citation. He is survived by my mother, his wife of 64
            years, Georgia Imogene (Barnhart) Proven's, a son and daughter and 4
            grandchildren, and one greatgrand child. Dad, Mom, my oldest son and I, attended
            the Division reunion at Ft Hood, Texas in 1986 together and had a great time.
            Dad had hoped to see some of his buddies like Louie Pilotti, Louis Guiglielmo,
            Sgt Carl Boettger, Lt. A. K. Zack, Ike Boston, Leo Manning, Boyd Thomson, Nick
            Palezonis, and others in &quot;C&quot; Company, however, he was disappointed at
            seeing so few people he remembered. He never attended another reunion,
            unfortunately. His passing is a great loss to all of us who loved him. He worked
            as machinist before and after the war until retirement in 1982 at age 65. He was
            in fairly good health until developing serious complications from Parkinson's
            disease about two years ago. Dad had kept a book of pictures of his wartime
            experiences which I now have, and I had given copies of some of them to the 2AD
            Museum at Ft Hood in 1986. I do not know what became of those pictures nor the
            museum. I have also recorded many of the stories Dad told me throughout the
            years as I grew. Dad also told these same war stories to his grandsons, my own
            two sons.</font>

            carry guns can't always be a saint. I've had to work most Sundays and at times
            my talk was tough, and sometimes I've been violent, because the world is awfully
            rough. But, I never took a penny that wasn't mine to keep... Though I worked a
            lot of overtime when the bills got just too steep. And I never passed a cry for
            help. Though at times I shook with fears, and sometimes, God, forgive me, I've
            wept unmanly tears, I know I don't deserve a place among the people here, they
            never wanted me around except to calm their fear. If you've a place for me here,

            Belgium. Speaking his native Cajun French, he met and befriended an 11-year-old
            girl who was scrounging for food in the garbage behind the mess hall. He learned
            that she lived several miles from the base but this was a main supplement of her
            family's diet. My father convinced the mess cook to give her the leftovers, and
            was &quot;adopted&quot; by her family. He performed an act of absolute human
            kindness in the midst of a great human unkindness.</font>

        <font face="Verdana">Upon returning to the States, he and his bride raised six children: Martin
            Jr., Jane, Janet, Joan, Mark, and Julie. He served as President of, and was very
            active in, the 2nd Armored Division Association. The Association again benefited
            from Martin's gift as an artist, as he donated a painting of 2nd Armored tanks
            in a German village to the Association in the 1980's.</font>

        <font face="Verdana">Forty-plus years after the war ended, he was able to take his wife of 50
            years to Belgium to meet the 11-year old girl he befriended. We are very happy
            to say that she is still a dear friend to all of our family.</font>

        <font face="Verdana">Martin died on May 3, 1998 after a four-year battle with cancer. During his
            illness, he never gave up his sense of humor and continued to care for and love
            his wife, children, and six grandchildren, who knew him affectionately as
            &quot;Big Papá.&quot; At his Memorial Service, one of the men with whom Martin
            served said he never knew anyone who had an unkind thing to say about our
            father. He is with us always. Mark, Martin’s youngest son, says that when he is
            working on any of a thousand projects, from painting a room to building a fence,
            our father is constantly telling him &quot;Not that way, Mark!&quot;. Dad's
            always right, whether Mark listens to him or not. He has made his presence known
            and felt in 1000 little ways every day, from his artwork to a remembered giggle.
            Martin has made an indelible impact on all of our hearts. We love you, Big Papá,
            and we are forever grateful for the service you gave to our country for our
            freedoms. Written by family member.&nbsp;</font>

                to him. They really miss him coming by everyday with Oreo cookies. They loved
                him dearly. He also had many, many friends, young and old here in Tallahassee.
                Other survivors include two sons, James J. White (and wife Suzy) of Greensboro
                and Thomas Irvine White of Colorado; a daughter, Carolynne Whitefeather of
                Utica, N.Y.; three stepchildren, Margaret Hancock (and husband Keith), Jo Ann
                Lassiter of Orlando and Bill Keen of Hawaii; four grandchildren, Andrea Duval
                (and husband Craig) of Tallahassee, Tommy White of Greensboro and Nickey White
                and Joey White, both of Denver; and six stepgrandchildren, Jim Hancock of
                Tallahassee; Jill Lassiter and Jordan Dickens of Orlando, Wil Keen of Knob
                Noster, Mo., and John and Annie Keen, both of Hawaii.

        <font face="Verdana">I have always been very patriotic. I love my country, and
            have always been appreciative of everything that every service man has
            sacrificed for me. Recently, I saw &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; To be
            completely honest, I cried during most of the film. I have always known that war
            is awful, but this movie put it right in my face. You could never imagine
            anything like that. During the entire movie, it occurred to me over and over
            again how much courage, strength and love for the United States each and every
            service man displayed in war. During the first 26 minutes, which re-enacted the
            battle on Omaha Beach, I can't help but say how proud I felt that even though
            their fellow service man was lying dead on the beach, so many continued on to
            complete the mission. I had so much pride in my country and the people that made
            it possible for me to have everything this country has given me.</font>

            John Logan in his &quot;General Order No 11&quot;, and was first observed on 30
            May 1868, when flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate

    <p>
        <font face="Verdana">Congress has taken steps to ensure these patriotic GIs
            receive their ceremonial due. By law, as of Jan. 1, all eligible veterans will
            be entitled to military funeral honors signifying America's gratitude for their
            honorable service. Upon request, two service members will fold and present the
            American flag to surviving family members, and a bugler will sound
            &quot;Taps.&quot; If a bugler is not available, a high-quality CD will be used.<br>
            <br>
            At least one member of the funeral detail will be from the deceased veteran's
            parent military service. The other may be from the same service or another
            military service. Other authorized providers, such as members of a veteran's<br>
            organization, may be used to augment the military detail. No particular rank is
            specified in the law, but the services by tradition have ensured the person
            presenting the flag to the family is at least the grade of the deceased veteran.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;We believe this is a very important, meaningful and moving ceremony. It's
            an appropriate tribute for all of our veterans,&quot; said Gail McGinn,
            principal director to the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Personnel
            Support, Families and Education. &quot;People say the finality of 'Taps' and the
            presentation of the flag provide an emotional closure. The ceremony honoring the
            deceased veteran can be seen as an affirmation of the person's life, as well as
            an expression of the nation's gratitude.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Veterans' families have had a hard time obtaining funeral honors due to the
            growing number of requests and to concurrent military force reductions, McGinn
            said.<br>
            <br>
            One quarter of the nation's 26 million veterans alive today are over age 65.
            Department of Veterans Affairs officials project the rate of veterans' deaths
            will rise through 2008 to about 620,000 per year, up from 456,000 deaths in 1989<br>
            and 537,000 in 1997. At the same time requests for funeral details have risen,
            the active force, since 1989, has fallen from 2.1 million to 1.4 million, with
            about a third stationed overseas or deployed on contingency operations.
            Similarly, the reserve components have shrunk from 1.2 million to 900,000 since
            1989.<br>
            <br>
            In addition, 77 U.S. installations have closed since 1989, and 20 more will
            close by 2001. In many cases, funeral details now have to travel greater
            distances to provide support. McGinn's office examined 9,800 requests for<br>
            funeral honors received from June 1 to Sept. 30 this year and found 23 percent
            could not be fully supported and 2 percent received no support.<br>
            <br>
            While many veterans think of military funeral honors as a right, the honors grew
            from custom, not DoD policy. Until the new law, nothing actually said the honors
            were a mandatory function, McGinn said. Congress responded to<br>
            public concerns by writing a provision into the fiscal 2000 Defense
            Authorization Act requiring the military to perform at least a basic level of
            funeral honors upon request for all eligible veterans.<br>
            <br>
            By law, veterans are now eligible for military funeral honors if they served in
            the active military and were discharged under other than dishonorable
            conditions, or if they were a member or former member of the Selective<br>
            Reserve. Veterans are ineligible if they are convicted of federal or state
            capital offenses and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole or receive
            the death penalty.<br>
            <br>
            McGinn said military teams conducted 38,000 funeral honor ceremonies in 1998;
            1999 statistics are not yet available. Requests in 2000 are expected to continue
            rising as the ranks of America's 16.1 million World War II veterans<br>
            wither.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;In developing the policy, we realized the number of requests for military
            funeral honors was going to increase,&quot; McGinn said, &quot;The veterans of
            World War II are passing away -- we're anticipating that there will be about<br>
            1,500 deaths a day.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates about 572,000 veterans will die in
            2000. DoD anticipates family requests for funeral honors each year eventually
            will climb to at least 45 percent of the eligible veterans -- in 2000, that
            would be about 257,000 requests, McGinn said.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;Given the way we think the mission is going to expand, what we've tried to
            do is provide our veterans a dignified, professional ceremony and a proper
            farewell within the resources available,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a total
            force mission, so we will rely on both the active and the reserve components.
            Reservists who participate will receive a $50 stipend and a point toward their
            retirement. They may accumulate retirement points for funeral honors duty beyond
            the annual cap.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            DoD's new policy calls for funeral directors, rather than families, to contact
            the military. Military funeral honors must be requested -- they aren't provided
            automatically, McGinn noted.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;The funeral director would probably ask the family whether the deceased
            was a veteran and then discuss the option for funeral honors,&quot; she said. In
            this, defense officials are taking steps to ensure families and funeral
            directors know<br>
            how to request military honors and what the ceremony will&nbsp; include.<br>
            <br>
            McGinn said about 24,000 funeral directors are in line to receive DoD kits
            containing a directory of regional funeral honors coordinators and brochures
            with frequently asked questions, instructions on the proper folding of the flag<br>
            and the sequence of the ceremony. The kit also will include a compact disc of
            &quot;Taps&quot; professionally recorded during 1999 Memorial Day services at
            Arlington (Va.) National Cemetery.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;A live bugler is always the first choice, but finding one is always a
            problem,&quot; McGinn said. &quot;There are only 500 buglers in the whole
            Department of Defense and they're not strategically located across the
            country,&quot; she added. DoD officials also are sending the &quot;Taps&quot;
            CDs to veterans service organizations and to military units that will provide
            funeral honors. In lieu of a military bugler or the CD, families may choose to
            seek a professional or volunteer musician to trumpet the poignant
            &quot;Taps&quot; farewell, McGinn said. &quot;The bugler is supposed to be out
            of sight, as is the audio equipment if the CD is used,&quot; she noted. DoD
            plans to issue training videotapes starting early next year to units that will
            conduct honors ceremonies. The tapes will set a DoD standard in terms of how the
            basic ceremony is conducted.<br>
            <br>
            McGinn said she and other DoD officials are often asked whether the basic
            ceremony is all any veteran can expect. She answers, &quot;not
            necessarily.&quot; &quot;The services have traditions for the provision of
            military funeral honors,&quot; she said. &quot;A member who dies while on active
            duty receives a higher level of support in military funeral honors. The same is
            true of veterans who are war heroes, such as Medal of Honor recipients.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;The services, based on their traditions, may render additional elements of
            military funeral honors,&quot; McGinn said. &quot;Veterans organizations that
            currently provide military funeral honors can work with us in accordance with
            the law to provide other parts of an honors ceremony such as a firing
            party.&quot; A DoD Web site explaining the funeral honors process is scheduled
            to go online Jan. 1, 2001. A toll free number, 1-877-MIL-HONR, also will be
            available Jan. 1 for funeral directors to coordinate ceremonies.<br>
            <br>
            &quot;We believe it is important to demonstrate the country's gratitude to those
            who, in times of war and peace, have faithfully defended our country,&quot;
            McGinn said. &quot;We want the Department's Military Funeral Honors Program to
            do that for<br>
            our veterans and their families.&quot; (Paul Stone contributed to this story.)
