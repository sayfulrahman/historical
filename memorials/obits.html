metals. He was very seriously wounded on April 1, 1945, in Germany. After
retirement, Jeff and his wife planned and hosted reunions for the 82nd RCN for
nine years. Jeff said one of the most wonderful things about retirement has been
looking up veterans he has served with and getting to know them again. He also
was on the Ollie North War Stories in the episode &quot;Desert War.&quot; Jeff
returned to Belgium in 1997 to visit and was honored in the towns his unit had
liberated. He was a member of Lafayette Presbyterian Church and when it was new
in the '50s and '60s he served as a Deacon and then an Elder. He had very strong
feelings about what the Bible teaches and was never afraid to stand up for his
beliefs. He loved children and those in the Piney Z Community were very special
to him. They really miss him coming by everyday with Oreo cookies. They loved
him dearly. He also had many, many friends, young and old here in Tallahassee.
