                Ammunition, By Clinton B. Conger</strong> United Press Staff Correspondent. With

        <font face="Verdana"><strong>Brig. Gen. Issac D. White's 2nd Armored Division
                Infantry</strong> lost a bridgehead across the Elbe River near Madgeburg
            yesterday, but today the troops of the same outfit went across the Elbe to pay
            the Germans back. Elements of the 2nd Armored, &quot; The Hell on Wheels &quot;
            div.--now are operating in the expanded bridgehead held by Maj. Gen. Robert C.
            Macon's 83rd Inf., south of where the 2nd Armored foothold was lost at midday
            yesterday. Infantryman of the 2nd Armored Division were withdrawn in amphibious
            tanks after being battered and exhausted from enemy pounding by reinforced
            Germans.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font face="Verdana">For the first time since the 9th Army broke out from the
            Dortmund-Ems canal east of the Rhine, the military maps show organized German
            Divisions ahead. Armored Inf. of the 2nd who crossed late Thursday held their
            Trans-Elbe bridgehead alone for nearly 48 hours. The Germans hit them with shell
            fire, mortar bombs, tanks, the bombs and the gunfire of planes and
            counter-attacks of strength up to a battalion. Enemy artillery, blasting away
            with the same clear field of fire they would have enjoyed in a shooting gallery,
            repeatedly knocked out engineers attempts to build the bridge which would have
            enabled tanks to cross and help the infantry. Lacking air support, fighting on
            two &quot;K&quot; rations apiece for two days, their ammunition running low, the
            armored infantry drew back . Toward the end, they had only bazookas to fight off
            the attacks of German tanks. But the picture on the 83rd Division front is
            brighter. Both tanks and tank destroyers have reached the 83rd's line. On the
            southern flank of the 9th Army, holding a wedge in the Hartz Mountains are
            elements of good German Divisions.</font>

    <p>
        <font face="Verdana">As the present, it appears that the race for Berlin is
            suspended so far as the Magdeburg sector is concerned. In football talk, the
            German safety man nailed the 9th on about the 10 yard line, and from here on in
            the 9th will be bucking an eight -man or nine-man line. In the last 24 hours,
            enemy troops opposing the 9th have been identified as coming from units probably
            formed specially to defend the Berlin area. It is impossible to guess at this
            time whether a flying column could strike to Berlin, if can break loose from the
            remaining Elbe bridgehead, or whether it must wait until the area west of the
            river is cleaned out an the 9th Army is massed in straight along its entire
            length. ( Please note a 41st infantryman who was in the action described above
            in this article has his story of this action on the 41st AR site)</font><!-- #EndEditable "content" -->
