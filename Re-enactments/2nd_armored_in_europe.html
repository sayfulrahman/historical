<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">During the early part of 2006, the semblance of a
strategic plan came to fruition. This was only accomplished after the whole of
the convoy route was covered by car, detailed notes being taken of likely
troublesome areas and indeed the state of the roads and of course likely traffic
jam hot spots. Every commune implicated was consulted and their concerns over
the fact that we were coming (tanks as well!), had to be met and discussions
sometimes took place at odd hours, due to the fact that many of the mayors were
in small villages and were in fact part time mayors, many of which were already
hard working farmers deep in the Bocage. It is these farmer-mayors that were the
most receptive and showed such enthusiasm that sometimes it was difficult to pry
oneself away from meetings with them. They were oozing enthusiasm and wanted
their own village to show how much it appreciated the sacrifices made by this
famous armored division.<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">Past experience dictated that not only was it important
to get the initial planning correct, but that it was also vital to get the
publicity of the venture underway as soon as possible. The French
“civilians” however, were used to working two weeks ahead of their publicity
schedule which put a considerable strain on the French co-ordinating part of the
equation. In France some three weeks before the event was due to kick off, it
was a constant “battle” to ensure that newspapers, local press, radio
stations and indeed several television stations had not forgotten and that they
were going to attend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">In the UK, the logistical planning department was up to
its eyes in it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vehicles were still
being prepared and most of the members of 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored were still
preparing their uniforms, equipment, spare parts and a myriad of other
prerequisites. In the USA, the 14<sup>th</sup> Armored group had been involved
for some months preparing to ship out 3 M5 Stuarts to France only to suffer the
loss of the 3<sup>rd</sup> tank on the day before it was due to be loaded for
trans-shipment. Finally, 14<sup>th</sup> shipped out 2 containers consisting of
2 M5 Stuarts and 2 rather new looking Jeeps. Having personally witnessed the e
mails flying back and forth between the shipping agents and the shipping company
at 02:00hrs in the morning on one night, I was suddenly aware that some 18
months of work was coming to fruition. Sleep was not on the agenda that night
(or many other nights for that matter)! Additional problems that ensued would
require the intervention of the American Embassy in Paris as the US State
Department was reluctant to allow the “tanks” to be shipped out!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequent e mails and phone calls to the Assistant Military Attaché at
the Embassy were made by mobile phone whilst he was in Normandy planning for the
6<sup>th</sup> June. Endless problems like this were a constant factor in trying
to put together the event to satisfy criteria laid down by the French Government
and indeed complying with US regulations pertaining to armored vehicles and
arms. There was a constant stream of e mails between France, the UK and many
other countries for that matter and certainly the US end contributed
considerably to this (by what was now becoming) a “river like” flow of
communication.

untrained eye, but having been through the “mill” during the past 26 years
on many occasions it was all in “a days work,” which was additionally
aggravated by the current climate pertaining to terrorism (which was a serious
factor) which needed to be addressed. Emergency procedures were drawn up and
circulated to the French authorities which they adopted without question. This
was the level of co-operation for this remarkable act of remembrance which 2<sup>nd</sup>
Armored in Europe was embarking upon.<o:p>

Europe after having had no problems with its previous large event in 2004 in
France and Belgium, the Ministry of the Interior, French Customs and indeed the
Departmental Prefects were very helpful and indeed the Regional Prefect for
Normandy was a staunch supporter who clearly lead the way by stating; “I want
nothing to go wrong with this one, see to it!” After having left this
particular meeting, I was slightly “shell shocked,” but there were provisos,
one of which was that every single commune had to agree to the proposal!

their tracks and look back at the unbelievable life like “ghost convoy” from
the past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For miles we headed in

Cell phones were being useful after all! 14:19hrs Bernescq, crowds of people

Mayor that had been phoning constantly, I did look to see if anyone had a guilty
look on their face, but no, nothing obvious, in fact they were decidedly pleased
to see us, nothing much happens in theses “parts”. 14:26 arrived in Colombières

A GI<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>poked his head into the back

Sherman driving through a wall and then crushing a car before driving off sound
familiar?!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>My immediate reaction
was -its some sort of infantile joke! NO! It was true, having been prepared for
such an eventuality of a vehicle hitting a property over the past 26 years I had
never actually used the procedure on a tank and a house before! There was no
mistake now as to who was going to have to sort this one out! Fortunately the

the lady of the house on the side of the street and we were invited inside. We
were offered a drink; I accepted a coffee (black) and started to go through what
had happened. Tank driver being no where in sight, obviously hiding under a
hedge somewhere or inside his tank with the hatches closed – “buttoned
up”! Apparently the lady had given the driver a bottle of local cider to calm
him down! She or at least her house was the victim of the latest “débarquement”
but was not unduly perturbed by the experience except that all agreed that we
were all fortunate in that nobody thankfully, was injured. Possibly this was an
“exciting” event in the village, which was otherwise a remote settlement and

During the ensuing paperwork, I discovered that in fact the Mayor was in fact an
ex French Army Colonel and had used M5 tanks in North Africa! He knew them
inside out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He was only too aware
of the problems of moving such a vehicle on wet tarmac roads and he suggested to
the Gendarmes (who were looking over my shoulder the whole time) that everything
was in order and that we didn’t want to detain them further. In fact the
officer and the female officer were very nice and were more interested in my
experiences than making life difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
driver of Delta 2 (tank in question) was summoned to produce his paperwork for
photocopying and he subsequently disappeared as quickly as he had arrived.

Meanwhile a very excited Mayor had arrived and was eagerly asking questions
about the tanks and the armored vehicles. This was no ordinary mayor, a producer
of local cider and Calvados! He was also passionate about the history of his
commune. It was this commune that housed the local resistance hq and was the
scene of a very secret operation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During
the night of 9<sup>th</sup> July in 1944 a John Beresford Hayes (<i>codename
Eric),</i> was parachuted<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>into
a field near Fougerolles-du-Plessis some 90kms South from Neuilly-la-Forêt. He
spoke French fluently, even the local patois to perfection and was also fluent
in German, he was a first class SOE operative. The mission was called
“Operation Helmsman” and was a vital TOP SECRET mission to coordinate the
French resistance into providing diversionary tactics and intelligence to ensure
the speedy and effective launch of Operation Cobra.<span style="mso-spacerun:

become one of the most vital parts of the breakout in Normandy in 1944.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>“Eric” was moved up with the help of the resistance group from St.
Hilaire de Harcouet and they collected details of German troop movements,
details of their positions and strength etc.

time. He was the Colonel attached to 1st Army intelligence and during his
questioning he was also visited by General Bradley himself. A subsequent visitor
was non-other than General Patton himself who spoke French fluently and wanted
to assure himself that “Eric” was indeed the person whom he declared himself
to be (remembering of course that General Patton’s “séjournement” in
France at that time at Néhou camp was ultra top secret). Such a great deal was
“riding” on this individual that G2 had to be assured that this was not a
“plant”.<o:p>

movements on the way up to the beach head and recruiting at the same time for
the HQ to be set up in Neuilly-la-Forêt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
was also to become a training centre and the FFI from the south of the Bocage
region were also to be implicated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This

firing party were superb. Speeches were made and there were some VIPs from
Regional government there incognito. Pigeons were released from their baskets
and all enjoyed local cider and “other” refreshments. During the
“drinkies” I met a local (and there weren’t many of them who were there
during the war that were left), he would have been about 12 in 1944 and
“served” as a messenger for his father (resistance). He was “employed”
to take written messages to the resistance HQ at la ferme de BAGOT (La Mancellière),
under the strict instructions from his father that if he was stopped by a German
that he was to eat the piece of paper with the message upon it without<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>any delay. It wasn’t until after the war that his father explained to
him what had been going on!

slogan: &quot;Anything, Anywhere, Anytime - Bar Nothing.&quot; The regiment took
great pride in the <b>AAA-O</b> slogan, displaying it on their helmets and

Col. Flint confidently declared, &quot;The enemy who sees our regiment in

<p style="background:#F8FCFF">

of the realities of war and its sacrifices, for freedom is not free-as was said
in many speeches during that week! The Mayor gave his speech and we were then
ushered into the rooms above the town hall where a toast was given to the memory
of Paddy Flint and the soldiers that died in the liberation of the town. In fact
there was a photograph of Col Flint being decorated by General Patton in the
corridor; such was the belief of the commune that this episode in history would
not be forgotten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was one of

manoeuvre on the tankers part which was what we were to become accustomed to,
such was their professional attitude. They then moved to one side inside the Châteaux
grounds to then let the convoy pass and take their respective position in the
convoy so that when we entered the courtyard (and some courtyard) they were in
their correct position. We arrived at 14:21hrs. Well at least we had arrived and
all was well. Well at least we were all relieved to be there. The most amazing

came right off the cuff, just like a well rehearsed script from a film, this was
re-enacting beyond my wildest dreams. This one hour in this Châteaux courtyard
made all of the work and problems suddenly disappear into insignificance. The
members of the press were like children with new toys, they had never seen
anything like it! It was evident however, that everybody was very tired. I moved
around taking “stock of the situation” There in the replica of the Grange
Cavern in Liverpool in the Châteaux’s lower floor were some of 2nds crew
asleep in the comfortable arm chairs. All was well given the fact that we had
done battle with the weather, 2<sup>nd</sup> was in relatively good shape and
the professional attitude of the group was such that everything was in its place
and in order. It was nearing time to establish camp and so we rounded everybody
up and the convoy then moved out of the courtyard and around the northern side
of the Châteaux to its farm complex where our camp was to be for the next two
nights.

cooking under the arches brought a whole new meaning to cuisine. This camp would
not have been out of place in a WWII photo journal.<span style="mso-spacerun:

advantage for pitching tents and concealment against potential air attack. Some

their own tents. However, on this night much partying was to take place and a
certain number of bottles of calvados came our way.<span style="mso-spacerun:

<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">After having tried to get everything ready, the convoy
finally moved out of the Chateau grounds at 10:31hrs in the direction of St.
Gilles. All things considered, this was nothing short of miraculous considering
the night before. Our main destination for the morning was Marigny where we
arrived safely. Here the whole convoy assembled in the town square and then the
wreathe laying took place at the memorial and the firing party and honor guard
performed their usual volley which the locals appreciated very much. This always
gave an air of authenticity to the proceedings and was quite impressive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was followed by a vin d’honneur in the town reception room where
the contents of the official speech from the commune made it very clear that
Marigny was virtually flattened due to the carpet bombing that pre-empted the
start of Operation Cobra. Needless to say our very presence there on this day
was a stark reminder to the locals of the suffering that they endured during the
war. When we finally left Marigny, we continued on our way for the destination
of Coutances and then returned back towards the direction of Quibo, where our
afternoon ceremony in memory of 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored was to take place. The
sun shone violently all day. The heat was exhausting but fortunately there were
no hold ups due to breakdowns. The convoy arrived on time and the town council
were awaiting us, we were introduced to Madame le Maire who was a staunch
supporter of military remembrance and was still in contact with relatives of
some of those mentioned on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored plaque on the town
memorial.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Press were already
there, the town council had set up some refreshing drinks for us and then the
tanks arrived from the opposite direction which created a remarkable sight. The
road through the village was now blocked and once again, 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored
held another small memorial service in this remarkable village. The wreathe was
laid and then the refreshments were served much to the delight of those that had
been seeking the shade of some of the buildings from the sun. The result of the
“pincer” movement on this village was quite remarkable for as members of the
town were watching the main section of the convoy arrive on their left, the M5s
arrived from the right almost at the same time, thus creating the illusion that
the village had been surrounded. After some 55 minutes, the convoy then
assembled and moved off in the direction of the Châteaux at Cansiy where we
were fortunate to have another night. However, this was not the end of the days
proceedings, there was another welcome organized for us all in the form of a
Bocage Cider tasting at the regional government office in St Lo, which had very
kindly been authorized by the President of the Conseil Regionale Monsieur
Jean-Francois LEGRAND who was also a French Senator, it was he that had
supported the aims of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2<sup>nd</sup>
Armored from the outset. This was an opportunity to visit the post war buildings
of the regional government that the locals called “Mini Versailles”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The whole of the buildings were in white stone and although the
appearance from the outside was more traditional, the interior was pure, clean
modern functionality at its best. This building sat on the hill south of St Lo
as it was this town that suffered a considerable aerial bombardment.<o:p>

outside.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The site of the arrival of
the vehicle crews marching into the courtyard was impressive. We were very close
to the Château at Canisy and we needed to return to base as some wished to go

effort and it seemed that the stamina was never ending. Some dressed in A class
uniforms and then climbed aboard GMCs for the short run into town. The remainder
of us sat in the camp and prepared for the next day and oh yes, consumed the
remnants of the calvados and generally had a good time in talking about past
events and not worrying too much about what was to come. The tank crews were
undertaking maintenance again as they were usually occupied in this way at every

members of the camp had “captured” some prowlers in the camp in their guise
of 17 and 18 year old girls. An interrogation ensued as to who they were, what
they were “doing” and did their parents know where they were. It transpired
that all was well, but I had my doubts, but the troopers were nevertheless given
strict instructions and left to their own devices. There have to this day been
no complaints so one must assume that the “entente cordiale” is still alive

support and indeed had asked us how to best go about organizing our arrival. We
had purely indicated to him that in fact he had little to do except to authorize
our passage and we would do the rest. In reality, the Mayor had undertaken quite
a lot, he was determined that his commune at least would remember our passing!
Upon our arrival, drinks were laid on for us and the parking arrangements were
already in place – the village centre was filled with vehicles and then closed
off! We were at this point minus the M5 tanks as they were on their way to a
rendezvous some 5 kms from our final destination of the day at St Denis le Gast.
Our scheduled stop at Moyon soon sped by and we were then back into the country
lanes of Bocage country, driving through remote quiet areas that rarely saw any
traffic and certainly would not of seen a convoy such as ours since the war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">Our arrival at Tessy sur Vire came and went and we were
now on the main road which stretched out in front of us for mile after mile
going over hill and dale in the sure knowledge that we would very soon be back
in touch with our M5 tanks.<o:p>

<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">There were anxious moments when we could see nothing in
the distance and finally at 11:58hrs after coming over the brow of a hill some 5
kms from St Denis le Gast were the tanks, their V8 Caddilacs were already
running and as we passed them they were already running on the road and building
up speed, not that an M5 needs much of an area to build up speed! The convoy was
now complete and the M5 crews seemed to be in a busy mode as they were now back
in the “fold”. The run from hereon in was some 10 minutes not a long one,
but the sight of all of the vehicles stretching back for some 2 kms including
all of that armor was a sight to behold. Not a civilian car in sight, the
authenticity was something to be seen to be believed. When the convoy arrived,
there were very few people in the streets but within seconds of the convoy
turning left on the cross road opposite the church people were appearing from
the houses.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">The run for the day was thankfully without incident and
the convoy was now lining up to get onto the field that was “earmarked” for
the camp for two nights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was
going to be an important camp for 2<sup>nd</sup>. This village was at the heart
of the struggle that took place in July 1944 between 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored (and
indeed 82<sup>nd</sup> Recon) and a number of German elements trying to flee the
area due to aerial bombardments that were earmarked as a prelude to the start of
Operation Cobra. The reality of course was that 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored and in
particular its 82<sup>nd</sup> Recon Battalions were being used as a “cutting
edge” to punch through enemy lines and became so successful that they were
often<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>running off the maps that
were being used by GHQ for operational planning. General Bradley himself had
noticed this, but was fully aware of the value of their progress and encouraged
them further. It is easy some 65 years on to analyse these spectacular movements
during which brave men lost their lives, but we should never forget the
remarkable achievements made by these units and what they had to go through.

<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">As a French General from Paris remarked “ We are
aware that possibly today, younger generation have lost “sight” of these
actions and 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored’s considerable efforts to bring this period
in history alive will recreate a living re-enactment that will enable younger
generations to imagine in a more concrete way what actually took place”.

<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">So here we were; on day 5 in St. Denis le Gast, fine,
hot weather and the camp was opening to the public for the afternoon. In fact it
didn’t stop at the end of the day, they kept coming from far and wide and well
into the night!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was a nice

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">One bakery, a small shop and a restaurant-bar/hotel all
in close proximity. On the crossroads itself, there was a Panzer 4 which was
knocked out in 1944 and a local civilian was shot in an unfortunate accident of
friendly fire. Not to mention actions that took place adjacent to the Hotel and
the nearby “land of the dead”. This was an area that earned its name during
the 100 years war between France and England in the middle ages<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>and virtually on the same spot in 1944 history repeated itself. This time
endorsing the name that would remain with the area for evermore – The Land of
the Dead!<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">At St Denis le Gast we were joined by Patric Fissot and
John Torchio who were both historians of the area in their own right. Their
intimate knowledge of the battles and skirmishes that took place was outstanding
and they took great delight in taking out parties to various areas to visit
places which are now mentioned in the annals of history. This for many was a
remarkable experience. M5 tanks were seen to park on the very spots in wartime
photographs so that a modern day equivalent photograph could be taken. This was
something that really made passers by think; this was a literal remembrance, the
like of which had never been undertaken before.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">Our first night in St Denis le Gast was spent by and
large between the camp and the two bars, the latter two of course took a
hammering as due to the heat of the day, everybody had a thirst that was not
about to be quenched easily. The road side bar on the main road stayed open
until the early morning and the owner showed the eager drinkers some of the
relics which he had acquired over the years which were a welcome diversion to
the bottom of a drinking glass. The First Sergeant was seen doing his
“rounds” checking on all and sundry and indeed had one or two words of
advice for the officers as well. Nobody was precluded from his authority that
was clear. Even at this time of the morning he was still on the go and sometimes
we wondered how it was that this “stalwart” kept “his battery” charged.
He was more often than not found at the rear of the convoy dealing with
breakdowns or minor vehicular problems, this was a man that kept the very fabric
together and often was not seen near the head of the convoy at all until the end
of the day.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">So 2nd Armored settled into its first night in St Denis
le Gast and finally the gates of the camp were closed for the night, the
stragglers getting back to the camp only to find that they had to sign
themselves in. This in itself was a sight to behold, as some were clearly not
capable of navigating - even with a pencil!

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Dawn finally appeared and so the promise of another
fine day –or so we thought, surprises were in store! The convoy was assembled
and ready to move out at 09:29hrs, our route was to take us through La
Voltolaine, La Pompe, St Martin de Cenilly, La Pinetriere Notre Dame de Cenilly
and then on to Roncey where we were due to stop for refreshments. The car park
adjacent to the church was empty as promised by the town hall and the impressive
convoy pulled in and sought out the nearest bar which was forthwith
requisitioned as the Officers PX. 
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Roncey was a strange place, after having been virtually
razed to the ground after the bombing by the US Air Force in 1944 it
subsequently grew up out of the rubble to become a vibrant yet quiet village in
the heart of the Bocage. When we approached the town hall for permission to pass
through and indeed pause there, they were curious as to why we should want to
visit such an uninteresting place such as theirs? Obviously the war came into
the equation and of course the sheer devastation that took place there and it
was only until they were shown photographs of the vehicles and those of their
town in waste that they understood what we were about! Needless to say our
lunchtime visit in the middle of the week was not ideal for the locals, but as
much of the route for the tour it did mean that we would be able to move around
uninhibited. 
</span>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">The local butcher had set up his barbecue on the
pavement outside his shop and was selling grilled sausages in baguettes which
was a popular fare with our group. The price of which depended on what you
looked like (or so we thought)! 
</span>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">The bar/café was used to capacity and time was taken
to refer to photographs of the village after the US Air force had attacked the
2,500 armored German vehicles that we were in and around the village at the time
of the attack. The result of this attack basically ensued panic within the
German ranks, The Germans then making off in every conceivable direction
southwards to avoid the onslaught that was obviously on its way. What they
hadn’t bargained for was the close proximity of 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored
Division and its Recon units who were already behind enemy lines in places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The D38 being covered in its entirety by 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored Division
expecting action at any moment, this D38 was designated by the Germans as a main
route of escape from the “Roncey Cauldron” as the Germans had named it. The
actions undertaken both by individuals and 2<sup>nd</sup> as a whole in my view
has been understated in historical documents, what took place was a heroic
struggle to stem the flow of fleeing Axis troops which essentially was fired by
selfless actions by individuals who at times went up and beyond the call of
duty! 
</span>
<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">The D38 of course became a no go area and every
conceivable roadway, track and indeed field was therefore in use by the German
units trying to escape. Our departure from Roncey was to follow one of these
escape routes which was to bring another dimension to our now well publicised
presence in the area.<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">We left at 13:14hrs in the direction of Grismenil
utilising some very narrow Bocage lanes. As we approached the cross road on the
D49 we turned right which was the road of “la Landes des Morts”, “The land
of the dead”. We arrived at the memorial of the land of the dead and parked
the convoy along the side of the road; the atmosphere in this area is decidedly
eerie. We were then joined by the three M5s that then took up their respective
place in the convoy and the whole complement of troops stood in one long line in
the middle of the road adjacent to their respective vehicles. This was an
impressive sight that will never be forgotten by those that witnessed it.

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">The honor guard was then formed up and the 2<sup>nd</sup>
Armored wreathe was laid at the memorial which was followed by the firing of a
volley. This was a moving event that a number of locals turned out for.
Certainly we got the distinct impression that this was very much appreciated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After this Patric Fissot had on display photographs which were taken just
after the battle in 1944.

<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">It was distinctly very close weather and the roads were
worrying in that the slightest movement on them resulted in marks on the new
surface however, we were in the middle of the countryside and had no option but
to carry on. The convoy then finally moved off towards Les Hauts Vents this
being the area where the Americans had first seen the fleeing Axis vehicles
moving. We then carried on through Trelly where the Germans had their command
post and at the time, as elements of the US Army moved through the village,
certain German Officers were seen running “for it” across fields as the US
vehicles had passed adjacent to the roadside windows of the command post.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We then carried on around the loop of the roads behind Trelly and came
past the area where the German Commander Tychsen had been buried later on at the
side of the road. We carried on warily looking at the skies which by this time
were becoming decidedly black and somewhat menacing.<o:p>

it start to rain, but it started to throw it down with a vengeance. Every
vehicle had its canvas off! Then came the lightening and thunder. Thunder bolts
came down vertically and struck each side of the road simultaneously around us
in the lead jeep. This was like being on the receiving end of an artillery
barrage.

in a no win situation. Soaked to the skin trying to keep the paperwork off the
floor of the jeep on my boots in a canvas satchel to now avoid the increasing
lake which was now rapidly rising within the floor well of the GPW<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>(TITANIC and bilge pumps came to mind). The first Sergeant took the
decision to stop the convoy and pulled it off the road as driving was becoming
suicidal in the prevailing conditions. We ahead in the lead jeep got out of the
4x4 to put the canvas hood up.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">We had no choice, we had to try and keep our paperwork
dry, despite the fact that we now had the appearance of drowned water rats, the
two of us burst into a paralysing bout of laughter which made our sides ache, it
seemed that the slightest remark would render us completely immobile which would
only aggravate the pain that was now evident in our sides. Possibly this was the
“pressure valves” going off but it is something I shall never forget-looking
back to see the convoy moving through “monsoon” like rain and lightning
strikes on either side of the road, oh for a camera at that precise moment.

honor guard which due to the proximity of the camp to the ceremony location, now
involved a large part of the convoy crew members. This particular memorial
service in town was to involve the three M5s and a few of the armored vehicles
for effect; it was essentially a procession such as the village had not seen
since 1944. The most memorable aspect being that numerous members of 2nd Armored
were now wearing their spotted camouflage uniforms that were briefly issued in
1944 and then withdrawn shortly afterwards as from a distance they could be
mistaken as German camouflaged uniforms.

patrol and whilst passing her house they saw a shadow moving in the room,
thinking that it was a German sniper a trooper fired fortunately missing the
lady in question, but unfortunately falling glass from the window cut a vital
artery and Madame Guenier died some time later. At the time of the accident, the
Americans had expressed their deep sorrow and condolences, but the family and

Major Ken Dungey (retired) whose very own wife of long standing (who was French

to everyone that knew her. It was largely thanks to her and her continuous
efforts that the memorials for 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored were established. She was
a driving force whom a great number of people had a great deal of respect for. I
had the privilege of knowing her albeit briefly, but she was from a rare breed
of dependable people and it was she that was so looking forward to seeing 2<sup>nd</sup>
Armored in town and finally not to have her there in person on the day was
something that I thought about a great deal. Nevertheless, I did feel that she

at 09:08 which was only some 8 minutes behind schedule, as we pulled out of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>St Denis le Gast, it was with reluctance that I looked back to see the
convoy coming up behind. St Denis had been good and we would have some fond
memories of this commune and their hospitality. Our arrival in Gavray coincided
with the start of their Liberty Bridge week end which was something that had
become a special festival to celebrate liberation and freedom, which we happened
to be in complete “keeping” with. Some of us, who visited the town, had a

ticking on (as ever) and we had an appointment in the commune of Le Chefresne.
Convoy moved out at 10:14hrs and then after having disappeared from the main

encountered very little problems with oncoming traffic in these lanes.<o:p>

10:12hrs. Upon arrival (a one time military cemetery, which happened to be one
of the temporary war time cemeteries that had its ‘compliment’ transferred
to Omaha cemetery upon completion) we were greeted by the locals. This site had
been preserved by the commune which really was something that the locals were
keen on as it was the last known temporary cemetery in existence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Here the commune was in numbers, together with a tent, refreshments and
canapés. Finally the whole convoy was assembled and the procession on foot was
brought together and the wreathes were prepared for laying. It was at this point
that I noticed that FR3 television had turned up and were getting to grips with
their task in hand in earnest. Interviews left right and centre, asking
questions about vehicles and even filming discussion between NCOs and small
problems that were being discussed.

two wreathes were laid the first by a lady of some 92 years who had been
deported by the Germans during the war who survived her ordeal and then returned
to her native commune of Le Chefresne. One felt somewhat humbled to be in her
presence yet she was adamant that she was going to lay the wreathe as she was
not that “nimble” on her feet given her age. Our General lay the wreathe on
behalf of 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored and suddenly I became aware that the eyes of
the whole commune and indeed the French camera crew were upon us. This to Le
Chefresne was a very serious business. The reality of the whole ceremony being
highlighted by the honor guard firing their volley of three shots. There was a
“brief” eerie silence after the last shot rang out echoing across the
valley. A moving ceremony which I believe will not be forgotten for a long time
to come.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>

reluctant departure as I think we would have all liked to of spent more time in
this commune and reminisce with some of the residents but time as ever was
pressing. Our subsequent route was to take us past the 13<sup>th</sup> Century
Abbey of Hambye which was something to be seen, the ruins themselves looked
impressive as we passed and crew members gasped as they saw this remarkable
edifice tucked away in the countryside as it was. Message passed to the lead
vehicle Charlie 12 was down. Back up was in attendance we would carry on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>From here we were taking the back lane into Percy and all of the problems
associated with lanes (that were in fact two way) but were actually filled by us
alone. The Harleys were sent ahead to keep the road clear and get all traffic
pulled off the road to facilitate our passage. As we came into Percy, we crossed
over the Liberty Highway and then on into more lanes towards St Sever Calvados.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">As we moved along our route into deep countryside and
indeed Bocage region, people were standing at the side of the roads in the
middle of nowhere, in fact on one occasion the lead jeep was stopped by a
civilian bearing a bottle of home made calvados which we accepted with
gratitude. Timing now being important to us and the ever existing potential
problem of oncoming traffic this being something that occupied my mind a lot in
these narrow lanes that rose and dived down into valley after valley. Finally
nearing St Sever Calavdos, we were coming through the southern edge of the
Bocage region and the terrain was becoming more open. Shortly before we got to
St Sever Calvados Charlie 12 went down again near Sept-Freres, this time only to
be stuck for some hours. Although I do believe that a local farmer did oblige by
towing them into his farm yard. These country people were very obliging and
certainly appreciated 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored’s efforts very much indeed.

but with all of the difficulties and the unknown quantities this was a good
result for a difficult morning on the road. Upon arrival we were greeted by a
large number of locals and then the whole convoy formed up in front of the town
hall en masse. What a sight to behold. The town hall building itself having the
traces of machine gun bullets rising up one side of the granite. Refreshments
were laid on for us and with the heat of the day this was very welcome.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">Time as ever was ticking on and FR3 television had come
with us on the run from Le Chefresne and we had to establish camp. The commune
had reserved a field for us a stone throw away from the town centre and so the
convoy departed to occupy this; the latest stage of the “Back to the Bocage”
tour. Unfortunately for me, there was an inordinate amount of foot work to do
and a German BMW R75 sidecar was “requisitioned” and I spent some of the
afternoon being ferried to and fro. After having received some very worrying
looks, I decided to foot it as the “firing squad” was ever present in my
mind.

days programme and had organized<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>some skirmish troops to come into the town very close to the war memorial
and a jeep with General Patton arriving to inspect the troops. This coupled with
the arrival of tanks and armor into the car park in front of the Mairie was
deemed to be “exciting” footage by the camera crew. This was undertaken and
the whole thing passed without hitch with St Sever Calvados going out live on
the evening news report. The ceremony at the war memorial for 2<sup>nd</sup>
Armored Division was very well received by the locals who were out in force.
ONAC (French veterans association) were present as were the local fire brigade
that took part with their ceremonial axes. After the dramatic entry of the tanks
and armor, which sped into the car park, General Patton and the officers of 2<sup>nd</sup>
Armored who had taken part in the wreathe laying crossed the road to listen to
General Patton address the troops this time from the top of the steps of the
Town Hall. Meanwhile as the address to the troops was taking place, I was
interviewed by the reporter for FR3 who was asking numerous questions about 2<sup>nd</sup>
Armoured in Europe, its members, its aims and so it went on. The live aspect of
the broadcast wasn’t long, but the footage from the convoy during the day had
also been attached to the report and this was to give the group the publicity
for the one event that it wanted to undertake very much – the laying of a
wreathe and the fixing of a brass plaque to the memorial for 82<sup>nd</sup>
Recon at St. George de Rouelley.

open to the public, many visitors came in and a constant stream meant that the
gates had to be manned constantly (as they were throughout the whole tour).
There was also a vin d’honneur at the Town Hall which was not well attended as
with the run to St. Georges de Rouelley the next day, there was a lot to do.
There was a lot of equipment on display, people were out with their vehicles
taking comparison photographs and the camp kitchen was also in the process of

09:30hours. From the outset as soon as we “hit” the country lanes people
could be seen standing at the sides waiting for us to pass and to get their
chance to see this authentic wartime convoy on its route. As we passed through
villages people stopped, turned and stood at the side of the roads in awe of the
sight unfolding in front of their eyes. This was 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored in
Europe recreating the scene wherever it went. The run actually was without
incident and everything was now running smoothly, there were one or two
mechanical problems en route and one M8 had an ignition problem but as this was
very close to our destination, it was left in the very capable hands of the
First Sergeant. The head of the convoy arrived at destination at 11:31hrs, One

except that when we arrived I was greeted by some 5 Gendarmes who were not in
the best of humour! Apparently one of the towns we had passed through had
understood that were going to stop there, but as we hadn’t, and the
Gendarmerie Nationale had organised additional manning some sort of explanation
was required.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Mayor of St

which was in an apple orchard which was a fantastic location which also meant
that the kitchen could utilise the barn adjacent to the orchard. We had also
collected a guest on the way with the convoy, non other than Peter Gray. For
those who weren’t aware of the significance of this visit, Peter was
responsible for the military vehicle movement in Europe kicking off all those
years ago. He was a pioneer in his own right and went through some difficult
times in establishing his MVCG group which eventually became the MVT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

into here, but to each their own. Basically from Peter Gray’s efforts
virtually all of the groups in Europe can find its roots. To see Peter sat
amidst a “sea” of olive drab gave me a great deal of pleasure, it was nice
to think that 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored in Europe had the time to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

ceremony turned out to be a little more popular that originally anticipated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Most of the day hitherto was taken up with the establishment of the camp
and the crews of the respective vehicles were occupied with their own kit,
tents, bashers, weapons, fuel and a whole myriad of other things that these
crews were usually found doing whilst on camp. The question of showers arose
again and a nearby football field shower block was found and the keys suitably
requisitioned. It was not ideal but in those immortal words from “Fawlty

of period village buildings. Here the restaurateur had set up tables and benches
and provided a dance platform together with CD players, amps. and speakers.
Additionally, festoon lighting was already up and his speciality of paella was
already on the go! Around the corner from this square, white smoke could be seen
wafting its way around the buildings. It was one of the crew taking photographs.

appeared! No it wasn’t a ghost, but the more “adventurous artistic flair”
of Trooper McNally in full flight. I still don’t know to this day what the
First Sergeant had to say, but a photograph of this “altercation” does
exist. One can only surmise that the Centurion was indeed “lost” and needed

<span class="auto-style9">Time moved on and the time of the ceremony approached,
Ron and Lon Swonger and Major Dungey were to be at the ceremony together with a
number of local politicians and indeed one Senator who lived in the area.
Needless to say the town folk were there in number and the crowd control was non
existent until we arrived. The location of the memorial on the main road side
meant that one lane of the road had to be closed off and a temporary traffic
light system installed for the duration of the ceremony. Already in place was a
tented drinks table and the car parking was to be alongside in the apple
orchard. At this locality during August 1944 one M8 from A command of 82</span><sup><span class="auto-style9">nd</span></sup><span class="auto-style9">
Recon was hit by an 88mm round. The resultant explosion killed instantly all of
the members of the crew bar one who was walking to one side of the vehicle at
the time of the action. The survivor of the M8 crew Howard Swonger had always
felt a great sense of loss after this event and had vowed that one day he would
provide a memorial in memory of those that fell at that point so that for all
time they would never be forgotten. This task was finally accomplished after
some years and both he and Madame Dungey were able to locate some remains of the
M8 in the fields adjacent to where the action had taken place.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes" class="auto-style9">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style9">These pieces were then placed in the base of the new memorial when it was
built.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes" class="auto-style9">&nbsp; </span>

</span><span class="auto-style9">- a must! The Mayor of the town of St George de Rouelley was a man that
was passionate about this memorial for he can remember the action as he was a
small boy at the time and it was his mother that had ventured into the fields to
give the US infantry fresh milk to drink, taking no heed for the need to “keep
her head down”. For her the most important thing on her mind was to ensure
that the “liberators” had something to drink. </span> <o:p>

our vehicles from being delayed. This was duly undertaken and within minutes,
the M8s arrived, the barriers were pulled aside and they took up their place in
the car parking in the apple orchard. As they passed, the whole of the
spectators became silent. The M8s had obviously brought the whole thing alive in
their minds and then to see 2</span><sup><span class="auto-style9">nd</span></sup><span class="auto-style9"> Armored in Europe infantry marching,

for their continuing support in the remembrance of those Americans who gave
their lives for our freedom. As he remarked on this and on numerous other

<span class="auto-style9">Before the vin d’honneur, a salute was fired above
and across the road by the three M8s that were there to salute the crew of the
M8 involved in the fatal action at St Georges de Rouelley. The ceremony as a
whole was a moving experience and I found it hard to concentrate as the reality
of the “event in 1944” was ever present in my mind. The stories which I had
heard when researching the route and the people whom I had met all flashed
before me as I stood with the others before the memorial. I wondered at the
time, whilst looking around, what things were going through the minds of those
that were there for the very reason that they were in the town during the war.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes" class="auto-style9">&nbsp;
</span><span class="auto-style9">It was difficult to take in.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes" class="auto-style9">&nbsp; </span>
<span class="auto-style9">We
had already been through some moving experiences on this tour, but somehow St
Georges de Rouelley was something extra, something more alive, and something
very real and close to the hearts of the locals. In St Georges de Rouelley I had
found a commune that was prepared to bend over backwards and the Mayor was a
forceful person whom himself had had a heart transplant some 18 months earlier,
yet he was there doing what he could for those that gave their lives for us and
despite all of our groans and moans that we had had on the tour, this was a
Mayor more than anybody else that knew the meaning of sacrifice, duty and honour.
It was being in the presence of people like this Mayor that I felt humbled, the
meeting of Madame Dungey before her untimely demise was also similar, except
that she was a person who didn’t know the meaning of “no” and its
“impossible”.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes" class="auto-style9">&nbsp; </span>
<span class="auto-style9">In this town, 2</span><sup><span class="auto-style9">nd</span></sup><span class="auto-style9">

<span class="auto-style9">The vin d’honneur was an opportunity for us all to
mingle with the locals and I managed a glass with the Chief of Police, possibly
we had both been humbled by the days experience and I think that really our own
personal agendas paled into insignificance alongside the importance of what the
event was all about. The French Senator that appeared “incognito” was
visibly moved by the ceremony, he left after the event in a pensive mood and
again I wondered what was going through his mind. The Mayor had a tear in his
eye and I knowingly shook the hand of a man who more than anybody else there
knew how very important the event was for the young of the commune.</span><o:p>

were in full party mode. There was even a small property that was for sale in
the square with an outside staircase. Some enterprising GIs used the stairway
for group photos and even a mock “house search” which the Mayor showed some
concern about, but after he was reassured that we weren’t actually going to
use any explosives or bullets he smiled. Well, that is what I understood!</span><o:p><span class="auto-style9">

to depart our St George de Rouelley at 09:57hrs. This ‘leaving’ from St
Georges de Rouelley was definitely tinged with sadness and I personally looked
back to see the convoy pulling out of the town, there is something about a line
of M8s on the road which cannot be described in words, but given the additional
vehicles, the convoy was something else. This was now a well oiled machine and
running well. Isn’t it a pity that once things start to go well, you have to
pack up and go home? That’s life!</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes" class="auto-style9">&nbsp; </span>

A WWII German vehicle appeared from nowhere which
wanted to join in, the driver and vehicle was duly despatched to go

tanks put into place and the convoy was assembled in the correct procession
order and the infantry demounted ready to “take the town”. So at 14:15 hrs
the procession commenced, it was very hot, brilliant sunshine and no wind, the
infantry had nearly<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>three quarters
of a kilometre<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>to cover and frankly
the lack of public concerned me a little.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
do however know that the commune had advertised the parade and there was no
reason for there being so little interest except that it was Saturday and people
had things and shopping to do for the week end, as they do in France. <o:p>

infantry had literally “taken” every shop doorway and building en route. We
were greeted at the square outside the town hall with a cordoned area taped off
with red and white plastic tape which was our reserved parking area for the
night as we were going to use the functions hall to both eat and sleep in which
would at least negate the hassle of pitching tents on the last night and
frankly, there was enough to do as it was. Security as always ‘in mind’, a
guard rota system was effected immediately. Fortunately for us we managed to get
everything within the square and the vehicles were a very impressive sight.<o:p>

The official wreathe laying ceremony was commenced at
15:45 hours; the cortege was led by the town police when everything was in
place. The national anthems followed by Taps was played after the laying of the
wreathes, the honor guard then fired a three shot volley and then the two
minutes silence came. After which we processed back to the Town Hall. Here there
was a vin d’honneur and the usual speeches, a superb elevated view of the
convoy parked up could be had from the balcony of which a number of people took
advantage. <o:p>

nevertheless his account of the virtual levelling of the town by aerial
bombardment was brought to mind. Here was a town that had really suffered as it
was by and large an important crossroad town. The floor was then left open for a
reply which I took up. I talked briefly about 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored in Europe
its “raison d’etre” and who had come from where. Finally after having
thanked the commune for their hospitality I asked them not to forget our passing
on that day, not to forget those that gave their lives for our freedom as this
commodity was not free and finally, not to forget our duty to remember. The
speech ended to a round of applause and the serious business of a glass or three
was “undertaken”. The officials were left behind shortly after as we had yet
still more to do! <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">We had to then move into the functions hall, time was

this was undertaken by some of the convoy crew who were by this time exhausted
just like everybody else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
problem of the vehicles being in the town therefore precluded us from all being
together for the “last supper” but security for the vehicles and equipment

his usual fashion to project his voice to the back of the hall. His message came
through loud and clear, there were various pieces of outstanding V mail to be
delivered to the respective troopers and myself being one of them. The girls had
been very busy in preparing these which were much appreciated as they
contributed greatly to the authenticity of the tour.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">Captain Heighes was next during which time an update
was given and numerous certificates were handed out and then the tour T shirt
(which I personally never got) I was too busy elsewhere to worry about that.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">After the official part of the evening was over, a
number of die-hards went into the nearby town for a beer or two. In typical
French fashion, everything was closed! However, we managed to find one that had
remained open adjacent to the war memorial, so here was one enterprising bar
owner who actually paid for a round of drinks on top of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A good time was had by those that were there, and there was a little time
to reflect and muse over what had happened during the tour. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
I think that at this stage of the tour, everybody was
very tired and it showed, yet we had to get through the evening as best we
could, it would be clear that although we had no need to erect tents etc
everybody was eager to hit the “sac” reasonably early. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
As soon as the bar closed everybody went back to the
functions hall where we were based and the hall was the scene of some strange
bundles in the form of sleeping bags and some of these were snoring in various
tones in a sort of “melodic harmony”. I decided that I would stay up and
went out to the “Argentan Siege” to see if there was any life. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">Indeed there was and I spent most of the night talking
and walking around the 2006 equivalent of “Custer’s last stand”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As the night wore on I decided that I too would try out the floor of the
hall and managed some 2 hours in all. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">At about 07:30 hours it started to rain!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Everybody was up at this point getting ready to prepare to move out.
Sunday 30<sup>th</sup> July, no movement allowed on a Sunday for the
transporters, I had to issue permits and ensure that the drivers had the
necessary paperwork and then attend to the jeep which needed the canvas putting
up, on board we had all of our dress uniforms and it didn’t look as if it was
going to be a dry day. What luck!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
Phone calls to the police in Caen to ensure that the
escorts were all arranged which was absolutely essential as we had a full
programme for the day and it was essential that everything ran on time. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">At 08:45 hours the town Police arrived to escort us out
of town after which we would be on our own until we reached Falaise. At 09:14 we
moved out under escort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was clock
watching all the way, the rain had eased slightly, but it was uncomfortable. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">Our ETA was 09:45 and we arrived just in time to see
our two Gendarmerie Nationale motorcyclists. We met up with our tanks adjacent
to the Châteaux where William the Conqueror was born and then proceeded to do a
tour or two of the ancient town of Falaise pausing momentarily to lay a wreathe<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>at the war memorial. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">We finally left Falaise at 10:53hrs, it was now raining
and we were becoming concerned about the arrival time in Caen. Everything was
fine until at 11:10hrs Charlie 29 broke down and Charlie 1 was struggling. The
First Sergeant was there, they were in good hands, and the rest of the convoy
had no option but to carry on.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">The Gendarmerie Nationale took us directly into the
centre of Caen<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>upon arrival<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>at 13:00 at our form up point for the parade the Police Nationale turned
up and so did the Town Police, words were exchanged between myself and them and
nobody was really sure whose jurisdiction ended where! Well at least I didn’t
and it wasn’t very clear who did! However, no harm, we were all working
together for one aim.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
The transporters were then escorted to their park up
point for the collection of the tanks for the end of the parade and upon the
return of the Police a short briefing was held between us so that we could just
recap exactly what was happening and at what time. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
Taxis had to be arranged, the military base had to be
contacted and there was no reply. The town Police got hold of them so that they
would be expecting the American tanks at the end of the parade. At this point a
number of the vehicle crews went off in search of a sandwich and found a shop
that was open fairly close by. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
13:10 hours a small honor guard (thanks to the Dutch)
went to the resistance memorial in three vehicles to place a wreathe. This was
accomplished and then the vehicles returned to the parade start point.
Additionally one track had to go to the town Police car park where it was to
remain until being collected the following day for its return to Belgium.
Meanwhile the First Sergeant had phoned and wanted to know exactly where we were
in Caen. For those who are not familiar with Caen, it is not easy to describe
how to get there, but all was well. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">The parade started at 14:00hrs exactly and the one way
system nearby was changed to allow the convoy to move through to its route. Once
on the route, the streets were virtually deserted! Some did question why we
bothered, but in answer to this, I would just say that it was worthwhile as
virtually no military vehicle group has officially paraded through this capital
of Normandy<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and that as a result we
now have a positive rapport with the authorities which is important for the
future of 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">The troops found it hard going but finally we neared
the end of the parade point and immediately the tanks reached the transporters,
they were driven straight onboard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
convoy then organized itself ready for the Gendarmerie Nationale escort to the
docks. This operation was executed with military precision and was accomplished
in a timely manner.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">The American tanks were then taken to the military base
by escort at high speed crashing all of the red lights en route to the great
enjoyment of the spectators who happened to be in the street at the time.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">The convoy left Caen on time and arrived at the docks
on time at 15:45hrs as the tickets booths were opening to take the vehicles on
board.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Gendarmes left and we
were left to say our good byes in a hurried fashion. Those that had to remain in
France were saddened to see our fellow adventurers depart, but we knew that it
would be difficult as it has been on countless other occasions and so we all
went about our business of getting home.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-family:&quot;Gill Sans MT&quot;;
mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">The French authorities were delighted with the result
and we should be aware that a number of individuals made an unprecedented effort
to get this convoy on the road. Further than that, the tour was a remarkable
“festival of remembrance” which 2<sup>nd</sup> Armored in Europe should be
justly proud of its team and its achievement. It is of course only right that
events like this should be encouraged to further remind people of the sacrifices
made so that we might be free today. I for one will be ready to stand up and be
counted on the next one, and there will be another!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I am of the firm belief that we cannot learn by forgetting and certainly
should not forget<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>those that gave
their lives to enable us to be here today. <o:p>

</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" class="auto-style7">In this respect the group is now planning a potential
tour to Magdeburg in Germany.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
are now in the process of looking for sponsors and indeed we would welcome some
assistance by any veteran to help us by giving us town names where the Recon
Battalions passed through on their way to Magdeburg and any pertinent
information that they may feel might be of interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:
